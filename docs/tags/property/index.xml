      <description>&lt;p&gt;Film: Chuck Norris vs Communism (2015)
1h 18min | Documentary, Comedy, History | 12 November 2015 (Germany)
A documentary about how western films were smuggled into Romainia during the rise of VHS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Points
Why did we pick a documentary for our first film, even though our focus is Philosophy in Fiction?
What is the film about?
How did contraband films change Romanian culture? How does it compare to western culture from the same era?
How did Zamfir create and develop the film market?
In what ways does this film reflect media access on the internet today?&lt;/p&gt;
