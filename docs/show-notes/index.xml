      <description>A technologically competent production, this film explores the moral issues of a mission to save humanity by creating a super-being.
Plot In the near future the Earth is reaching it&amp;rsquo;s oft-reported demise and becoming uninhabitable to humans. So the geniuses at military headquarters decide it will be able to modify humans so that they can live on the much-less-habitable moon of Saturn, and then transport them there.
Before you ponder the absurdity of mutating and moving several billion people, or just a few so that the abandoned masses can perish knowing that their tax dollars went to a noble cause, keep in mind that the mission is just a ploy to illustrate the injustice of the loss of self.</description>
