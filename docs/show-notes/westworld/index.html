				<dt class="col-6">Dolores Abernathy</dt>
				<dd class="col-6">Evan Rachel Wood. One of the series&#39; central characters. She is the oldest host still working in the park. Dolores is a rancher&#39;s daughter who discovers her entire life is an elaborately constructed lie. Her aesthetic drew influences from Andrew Wyeth&#39;s painting Christina&#39;s World as well as Lewis Carroll&#39;s Alice.</dd>
			
		
			
				<dt class="col-6">Maeve Millay</dt>
				<dd class="col-6">is portrayed by Thandie Newton. Maeve is a host who acts as the madam of Sweetwater, the largest town in Westworld. Like Dolores, she also discovered that her life is an elaborate lie.</dd>
			
		
			
				<dt class="col-6">Bernard Lowe</dt>
				<dd class="col-6">is portrayed by Jeffrey Wright. He is the head of the Westworld Programming Division and creator of artificial people. Later in the plot, he is revealed to be a host under Ford&#39;s control, made in the image of Westworld&#39;s co-creator, Arnold Weber. &#34;Bernard Lowe&#34; is an anagram of &#34;Arnold Weber&#34;.</dd>
			
		
			
				<dt class="col-6">Arnold Weber</dt>
				<dd class="col-6">is portrayed by Jeffrey Wright. He was the co-founder and developer of Westworld alongside Ford.[6]</dd>
			
		
			
				<dt class="col-6">Theodore &#34;Teddy&#34; Flood</dt>
				<dd class="col-6">is portrayed by James Marsden. He is host in the role of a gunslinger who returns to Sweetwater looking to rekindle his relationship with Dolores.</dd>
			
		
			
				<dt class="col-6">Armistice</dt>

She later forms an alliance with Charlotte Hale and Delos to conspire against Dr. Ford and remove him from power. Ford orchestrates the death of Theresa soon after by having Bernard murder her.[7]</dd>
			
		
			
				<dt class="col-6">Lee Sizemore</dt>
				<dd class="col-6">is portrayed by Simon Quarterman. He is Westworld&#39;s narrative director, whose artistic temperament aggravates his co-workers.</dd>

				<dt class="col-6">William</dt>
				<dd class="col-6">also known as the Man in Black or Bill, is portrayed by Jimmi Simpson as a young man and by Ed Harris as an elderly man. He was a reluctant first-time visitor to Westworld, joining his future brother-in-law, Logan. Initially dismissive of the park&#39;s more lascivious attractions, he slowly uncovered a deeper meaning to the park&#39;s narrative. He later became a rich, sadistic Westworld guest searching for a &#34;deeper level&#34; in the park. Outside of the park, he has achieved prominence as the owner of a medical foundation, and is a board member of Delos.[10]</dd>
			
		
			
				<dt class="col-6">Robert Ford</dt>
				<dd class="col-6">is portrayed by Anthony Hopkins. He is the founder and creative director of Westworld. It was eventually revealed that he had been orchestrating the host uprising with his new and final park narrative, &#34;Journey into Night&#34;.

				<dd class="col-6">is a host role formerly filled by Lawrence, portrayed by Clifton Collins Jr.. In the season 1 flashbacks, the host El Lazo encountered Logan, William and Dolores in Pariah. Sometime later, the role of El Lazo was assigned to another host. In season 2, the new El Lazo is portrayed by guest actor Giancarlo Esposito.</dd>
			
		
			
				<dt class="col-6">Charlotte Hale</dt>
				<dd class="col-6">is portrayed by Tessa Thompson. Delos&#39; executive director of the board overseeing Westworld. She seeks to smuggle Ford&#39;s hosts&#39; data out of Westworld on behalf of Delos and allow the company to wrest control of the park away from him.[12]</dd>
			
		
			
				<dt class="col-6">Peter Abernathy</dt>
				<dd class="col-6">is portrayed by Louis Herthum. He is a host and Dolores&#39;s father. Once he is decommissioned, the role of Peter Abernathy is given to another host (portrayed by recurring actor Bradford Tatum in season 1) and he is put into cold storage.

              DELORES: Maybe they don&rsquo;t have the courage. A strange new light can be as frightening as the dark.
DELORES: Will you bring me back? I&rsquo;d like to see it again.
Delores seems to be aware of desires, of evaluations of goods.
She also has this continuing context. She has something like altzheimers, but also a residual of ongoing context.
Her evaluation seems superficial. &ldquo;It looks like someone scattered the stars on the ground&rdquo;.

DELORES (Looking reflective)
BERNARD That answer doesn&rsquo;t seem to satisfy you.
DELORES Because it&rsquo;s not completely honest.
BERNARD (shaken) You.. you, frighten me sometimes Delores.
Visual reflection sequence
BERNARD (in reflection) Is this now?
Reflecting on the massacre, Bernard remembers discovering oil leaking from his ear and realizes that he will be a target for extermination.
