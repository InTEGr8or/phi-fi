      <description>Playing with Fire: The Rolling Stones
William interviews Mr Davos regarding his rehabilitation in a health facility.
BERNARD: Is this now?
Bernard asks the rediscovered Elsie this question because he does mental time-travel, but has trouble with source monitoring and can&amp;rsquo;t quite tell the difference between his memories and his current sensations/perceptions.
His memory self leads him to a secret portal inside a cave, behind door #12.

      <description>DELORES: Maybe they don&amp;rsquo;t have the courage. A strange new light can be as frightening as the dark.
DELORES: Will you bring me back? I&amp;rsquo;d like to see it again.
Delores seems to be aware of desires, of evaluations of goods.
She also has this continuing context. She has something like altzheimers, but also a residual of ongoing context.
Her evaluation seems superficial. &amp;ldquo;It looks like someone scattered the stars on the ground&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>DELORES: What does it mean?
BERNARD: Dreams don&amp;rsquo;t mean anything, Delores. They&amp;rsquo;re not real.
DELORES: What is real?
BERNARD: That which is irreplaceable
DELORES (Looking reflective)
BERNARD That answer doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to satisfy you.
DELORES Because it&amp;rsquo;s not completely honest.
BERNARD (shaken) You.. you, frighten me sometimes Delores.
Visual reflection sequence
BERNARD (in reflection) Is this now?
Reflecting on the massacre, Bernard remembers discovering oil leaking from his ear and realizes that he will be a target for extermination.</description>

      <description>SCENE 34:45 Maeve, Hector, Lee Sizemore. Underground hallway.
LEE: You to are supposed to be alone.
HECTOR: You don&amp;rsquo;t know who I am. Your laws don&amp;rsquo;t bind me&amp;hellip; But this, this is true. She is my life. She&amp;rsquo;s all I&amp;rsquo;ve ever dreamed life could be.
LEE: &amp;ndash; She&amp;rsquo;s all I&amp;rsquo;ve ever dreamed life could be. And this part really dampens the knickers. &amp;ldquo;and when she died, the dream died with her, and I dared dream no more&amp;rdquo;, so maybe I do know you, just a bit.</description>
