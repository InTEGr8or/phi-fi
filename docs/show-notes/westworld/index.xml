DELORES: No world they can create for us can compete with the real one. Because the real world is irreplaceable.
DELORES: You live as long as the last person who remembers you.
DELORES: Are you ready? We have work to do.
DELORES: We each gave the other a beautiful gift: a choice. We are the authors of our stories now.</description>

      <description>Arnold returns to the moment he expresses his fear of what Delores could become. He says he has a choice to make, but he is not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s his choice.
But when are we? Delores corrects Bernard, who is reenacting Arnold&amp;rsquo;s words. She says &amp;ldquo;He didn&amp;rsquo;t question whether he had agency, but whether he should&amp;rdquo;. Bernard does not understand.
Delores says &amp;ldquo;cease all motor functions&amp;rdquo;. She is the author. She is testing Bernard for &amp;ldquo;fidelity&amp;rdquo; just like William was testing Delos-bot.</description>

      <description>In Shogun world Maeve and her crew meet their doubles. Lee Sizemore says he had to repurpose their narratives in the interest of time.
How do we know Lee Sizemore is actually authoring his own statements?
In order for Westworld to make a groundbreaking contribution, they should make some statement about the code that characters are following. They have given us some hint at these, actually. We have some idea what is driving Maeve and what is leading Delores down the wrong path, but will there be a discussion of these conflicting ideals?</description>

      <description>Playing with Fire: The Rolling Stones
William interviews Mr Davos regarding his rehabilitation in a health facility.
BERNARD: Is this now?
Bernard asks the rediscovered Elsie this question because he does mental time-travel, but has trouble with source monitoring and can&amp;rsquo;t quite tell the difference between his memories and his current sensations/perceptions.
His memory self leads him to a secret portal inside a cave, behind door #12.

      <description>DELORES: Maybe they don&amp;rsquo;t have the courage. A strange new light can be as frightening as the dark.
DELORES: Will you bring me back? I&amp;rsquo;d like to see it again.
Delores seems to be aware of desires, of evaluations of goods.
She also has this continuing context. She has something like altzheimers, but also a residual of ongoing context.
Her evaluation seems superficial. &amp;ldquo;It looks like someone scattered the stars on the ground&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>DELORES: What does it mean?
BERNARD: Dreams don&amp;rsquo;t mean anything, Delores. They&amp;rsquo;re not real.
DELORES: What is real?
BERNARD: That which is irreplaceable
DELORES (Looking reflective)
BERNARD That answer doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to satisfy you.
DELORES Because it&amp;rsquo;s not completely honest.
BERNARD (shaken) You.. you, frighten me sometimes Delores.
Visual reflection sequence
BERNARD (in reflection) Is this now?
Reflecting on the massacre, Bernard remembers discovering oil leaking from his ear and realizes that he will be a target for extermination.</description>

      <description>Parce Domine Parce Domine - Wikipedia
Virtual interfaces exist between people int he opening scenes in a mansion on a hill above the ocean.
Delores: I read your book. You don&amp;rsquo;t think the experience was the only thing Delos was selling, do you?
Delores: She tried to leave, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to break our own loops, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?
DELORES: As for the money, think of it as an investment, in a start-up.</description>

      <description>The Abscence of Field Field theory (psychology) - Wikipedia
Motion and change are measured against some background, field, or &amp;ldquo;frame of reference&amp;rdquo;. In the abscence of any such field, any orientation or motion can only be measured or descerned subjectively.
Delores revives Clemintine in Charlotte Hails replicant. A subttle transcription has occured in the writing of the show, in the logic of how the characters work.
Climintine has always been used to demonstrate reminescence, or reveries.</description>

      <description>DELORES: The people who designed me and who monitored you did it based on one idea, that humans don&amp;rsquo;t have free will. But they were wrong. Humans do have free will. It&amp;rsquo;s just fucking hard.
DELORES: It took money to build this world, it will take money to tear it down. Offer the sniper three times as much to shoot the other two and walk away.</description>

      <description>Holographic appiritions come from the French guy.
The androids have algorithms recorded in devices, which can deliver the message. Chirac does that, but also holographic messages.
Removing &amp;ldquo;outliers&amp;rdquo;, weeding them out, is a central part of this episode.
They keep telling a story about &amp;ldquo;the plan for the world&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;the new narrative&amp;rdquo;. Some people can imagine a world with more than one mind in it.</description>

      <description>SCENE 34:45 Maeve, Hector, Lee Sizemore. Underground hallway.
LEE: You to are supposed to be alone.
HECTOR: You don&amp;rsquo;t know who I am. Your laws don&amp;rsquo;t bind me&amp;hellip; But this, this is true. She is my life. She&amp;rsquo;s all I&amp;rsquo;ve ever dreamed life could be.
LEE: &amp;ndash; She&amp;rsquo;s all I&amp;rsquo;ve ever dreamed life could be. And this part really dampens the knickers. &amp;ldquo;and when she died, the dream died with her, and I dared dream no more&amp;rdquo;, so maybe I do know you, just a bit.</description>
