						Fiction is the principle battlefield for philosophical ideas. It sets the stage for the other battlefields. Two characters or two different shows will make two different cases for a way to act.
					</p>
					<div class="article-summary">Shows such as LOST and The Matrix broke new ground on presenting philosophical questions and answers in new storytelling methods and dramatic &ldquo;footage&rdquo;. New technologies and ecosystems of film production created an environment that was fertile for richer stories and producers demonstrated that the demand was there too.
After LOST especially, the dramatic storytelling landscape has become much more accepting of presenting philosophical and ethical content explicitly, often with shows titled with their philosophical content, and characters named after the philosopher most famous for presenting or originating the philosophical domain.</div>

              In Shogun world Maeve and her crew meet their doubles. Lee Sizemore says he had to repurpose their narratives in the interest of time.
How do we know Lee Sizemore is actually authoring his own statements?
In order for Westworld to make a groundbreaking contribution, they should make some statement about the code that characters are following. They have given us some hint at these, actually. We have some idea what is driving Maeve and what is leading Delores down the wrong path, but will there be a discussion of these conflicting ideals?
