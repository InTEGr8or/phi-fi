      <description>In our podcast we use the Island as a metaphor. In the shifting tides of a relativistic computer generated worlds portrayed in modern sci-fi, populated by time-traveling worm-holes, supernatural aliens, and mystical superpowers, we are going to find our way back down to earth, where we actually live.
Other philosophical investigations of film, such as the many “The Philosophy of..” book reviews of film and television, will take the position that philosophical content must be investigated from a position of complete neutrality.</description>

      <description>We have discussed heroes in earlier episodes, such as Zaphir (Chuck Norris Vs Communism), Solomon Northup (12 Years a Slave), Mogly (Jungle Book), and Ray Gaines (San Andreas). We&amp;rsquo;ve looked specifically at the affect of heroic vision on the young minds featured in &amp;ldquo;Chuck Norris vs. Communism&amp;rdquo;.
We hadn&amp;rsquo;t considered how deep our exploration into the superhero universe would become when we chose to cover Pixar&amp;rsquo;s The Incredibles, but since our last podcast we&amp;rsquo;ve come to understand much more about the ideas behind the lore of these modern marvels.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Film: Chuck Norris vs Communism (2015)
1h 18min | Documentary, Comedy, History | 12 November 2015 (Germany)
A documentary about how western films were smuggled into Romainia during the rise of VHS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Points
Why did we pick a documentary for our first film, even though our focus is Philosophy in Fiction?
What is the film about?
How did contraband films change Romanian culture? How does it compare to western culture from the same era?
How did Zamfir create and develop the film market?
In what ways does this film reflect media access on the internet today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-is-this-film-related-to-phi-fi&#34;&gt;How is this film related to Phi-Fi?&lt;/h2&gt;</description>
