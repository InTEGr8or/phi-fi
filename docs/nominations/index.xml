      <description>Valerian is a story of heroism and adventure told over a love story background. The characters are interesting, especially considering that they are pretty young, and the story-line is exciting and engaging. The visuals are fantastic a treat all to themselves, and reason enough to see the film. The costumes, the landscape and the action scenes are pretty spectacular, but are well blended into the storytelling in the same way they were in The Fifth Element, only newer.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory is a strange thing. It doesn&amp;#39;t work like I thought it did. We are so bound by time. But now I&amp;#39;m not so sure I believe in beginnings and endings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first statement in Paramount Pictures &amp;quot;Arrival&amp;quot;. If you are looking for the philosophical direction the film is leading us in, you already have your answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement is made in a dreamy, inner-voice-over which spans cuts to the scene in a style which has become trendy in &amp;quot;groundbreaking&amp;quot; thought-pieces. A slippery relationship between time and memory is the main theme of the film, but &amp;quot;Arrival&amp;quot; takes it one step beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
