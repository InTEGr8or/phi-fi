		Several years ago I was unable to read fiction.There were so many exciting and fantastic developments in real - world technology and modern culture and society.I found it difficult to focus my attention on fictional stories when there were so many factual discoveries
		for me to make.

		I was making the mistake of thinking that even the best fiction was just entertainment and fantasy.I might have even viewed it as escapism.

		Over the last few years there have been a number of dramatic presentations which have completely reversed my point of view on this topic.

		A modern philosophy professor rightly attempts to derive a discovery - based explanation of right,
		such as intellectual property rights.

		The problem he runs into is the materialistic justification of property.How can a man claim ownership of his whole front yard,
		he asks,
		if he has not trod onto its entire surface ?

		"post_content": "The rapid integration of the internet into or lives over the last 20 years has produced some unexpected results. The frontier of computer advancement was largely expected to be in the artificial intelligence domain, but a conversing computer is still mostly in the future.

		One area that has seem phenomenal growth is the telling of human stories.Instant news from around the world has been in a growth spurt ever since cable news got it\ 's start in the 1980\'s.

		The web and privately produced media and free commercial publication systems have produced a society of news promoters.

		What type of new are we promoting and consuming ? A large and central part of popular news production is the stories of other lives.I would say,
		\"the stories of other people\'s lives\" but I must remind myself that many of these stories are fiction. Some of them are even in the form of brief scenarios where the characters are not even meant to be real individuals, such as the stories of Boris and Ivan, Aristotle and the hair, or the chicken and the pig.

		We express complex ethical scenarios and philosophical topics through the use of story narratives.

water, food and energy are the first concerns of astronaut Mark Wattney when he is stranded, left for dead, on Mars after an emergency launch during a storm.

			First his suit is punctured and he is wounded,
		but not only is he leaking blood,
		he is also leaking breathable air into the Martian atmosphere. He is faced with multiple emergencies in an ascending scale of importance and must perform a triage calculation,
		judging which problem is most urgent and how to conserve energy and supplies.

		The Martian is a study of economic concerns as the pertain to the preservation of life.He has to balance immediate,
		short - term,
		and long - term concerns during every scene.

		He has to take stock of his situation and one of the first thing he does is take an inventory of the supplies he has left remaining,
		but he doesn\ 't just have to conserve. He must also produce more than he consumes in production if he wants to survive until a rescue mission can reach him. Fortunately he is a botanist. He figures out how to get more potatoes out of the ground than he puts into it.

		Wattney is not the only person faced with economic concerns.The NASA ground crew starts to figure out that he is still alive and they want to redirect some satellite time to look at his location.The NASA director doesn\ 't want to look, not because of the cost of scarce satellite time, but because of the political cost of discovering a dead astronaut in an image.

		First his suit is punctured and he is wounded,

		The Martian is a study of economic concerns as the pertain to the preservation of life.He has to balance immediate,

		He has to take stock of his situation and one of the first thing he does is take an inventory of the supplies he has left remaining,
		but he doesn\ 't just have to conserve. He must also produce more than he consumes in production if he wants to survive until a rescue mission can reach him. Fortunately he is a botanist. He figures out how to get more potatoes out of the ground than he puts into it.

		Wattney is not the only person faced with economic concerns.The NASA ground crew starts to figure out that he is still alive and they want to redirect some sattelite time to look at his location.The NASA director doesn\ 't want to look, not because of the cost of scarce sattelite time, but because of the political cost of descovering a dead astronaut in an image.

Some of them are even in the form of brief scenarios where the characters are not even meant to be real individuals, such as the stories of Boris and Ivan, Aristotle and the hair, or the chicken and the pig.

		We express complex ethical scenarios and philosophical topics through the use of story narratives.

			A documentary about how western films were smuggled into romainia during the rise of VHS

			Key Points
			Why did we pick a documentary
			for our first film,

			What is the film about ?
			How did contraband films change Romanian culture ? How does it compare to western culture from the same era ?
			How did Zamfir create and develop the film market ?
			In what ways does this film reflect media access on the internet today ?

			##How is this film related to Phi - Fi ?

			Phi - Fi is about the philosophical impact of fiction on our lives,
			and by philosophical I mean the core basis of knowledge about reality and our place in it.So this documentary touches on the importance of philosophy thought and conversation through the medium of drama.Drama provides moral and aesthetic use cases and a common knowledge narrative through which conversations can be worked through and common ground can be reached. <!--more-->

			The VCR Liberation in the U.S.had a later similar event in Soviet Romania.In the U.S.many small mom - and - pop shops opened up to sell the VCR tapes of popular movies.This market was big enough to put a VCR shop in every mini - mall and every major street in a town.The mom - and - pops in the U.S.existed in a new market that was mostly free and unregulated,
			so it was easy
			for many people to start up.Some people even started by selling the videos out of the back of their cars before opening a shop.

			In Soviet Romania they were not operating in a free market,
			but were instead in one of the most restrictive societies in the Soviet Union. <

			The Fountain of Film

			The Western films became one of the most valuable commodities in Romania.It was what people traded their money in
			for,
			and it was what bureaucrats accepted as bribes,
			even top officials.Irina Nistor said it was“ my oxygen”,
			even after being confronted by secret police.She translated the films
			for years,
			not
			for the money,
			but
			for the chance to see all the films.

			Hollywood exports English speaking drama to every corner of the earth.It is probably part of the reason English is accepted as the international language of business,
			of air traffic control and other standards.

			Cheap,
			easily accessible drama with an American spirit was more popular worldwide than the British,
			French,
			and Russian products.Films are cultural products.

			He was trying to provide people with a valuable product and make money off it.

		Released in 2004,
		The Incredibles covers philosophy touching on the ethics of rescuing others,
		Individual Identity,
		and raises the question of whether greatness is ordained by nature,
		or developed by nurture.

		Mr.Incredible: Can\ 't the world just stay safe for ten minutes?
		Elastigirl: Leave the world saving to the men ? I don\ 't think so.

		Incrediboy,
		Buddy Pine,
		 feels forsaken despite being a self proclaimed biggest fan.He becomes the villain Syndrome.Could he have abandonment issues ? His first appearance in Mr Incredible\ 's life is at a time where Bob Parr, the man of incredible strength, couldn\'t imagine himself as a mentor or team mate. Buddy wanted acceptance and guidance from a role model.

		Dash Parr lacks stimulation and focus in his environment.Gifted with incredible speed he could envision a future in sports,
		but is discouraged by his mother
		for fear of standing out.He and his sister,
		Violet Parr,
		wish that they were normal.

		Violet lacks self esteem because of how her abilities make her different from other kids,
		especially boys.

		Bob is fired from his unsatisfying job,
		after throwing his boss through several walls
		for stopping Bob from helping a victim of a mugging.The layers of walls are like the instances where he was reprimanded
		for helping others in what the company considered a conflict of interest.Who in real life might believe that helping others is a conflict of rational self interest ?

		Bob\ 's new job working with Mirage causes a tear in his glory days hero suit. He takes it to Edna-E-Mode, an expert clothing designer whose artistic form follows function as demonstrated in her discussion with Bob about how many heroes die because of their stylistic preference of capes.

		Helen Parr enforces the ideal behavior they\ 're held to by society on her family because she believes it will protect them from harm. It incentivizes Bob to lie to his wife about his real habits, and his developing crisis becomes an opportunity when a super hero job is offered shortly after his termination from insurance.

		Buddy has weak relationships,
		and considers his partners to be disposable
		if their death may suit his own needs.This is seen when Bob Incredible bluffs his intention to kill mirage
		if he isn\ 't unbound. Syndrome\'s betrayal is responded to in kind, and Mirage chooses to support the Incredibles.

		Mirage : \"Next time you gamble. Bet your own life.\"

		Dash\ 's curiosity saves his and his sister\'s life, when he he witnesses the ignition of a rocket from within the cave\'s tunnels. Immediately after, Helen eavesdrops the surveillance station curious of her husband\'s location.

		Syndrome : \ "When Everyone\'s Super, No One Will Be.\"

		Violet is smart and innovative.She breaks electric bonds by interrupting them with her force field.She is able to troubleshoot a route to Syndrome by using prior rocket launch coordinates.

		Bob: I can\ 't lose you again. I\'m not strong enough.
		Helen: If we work together,
		you don\ 't have to be.

		Syndrome\ 's last grand gesture is to kidnap the baby to groom as his future side kick. Violet reacts by protecting her family from the falling aircraft.

		I\ 'm reminded of a quote from another movie, The Straight Story. \"A stick by itself is easy to break. Tie a bundle of sticks together and it becomes much harder. That\'s a family.\"

		Armsby“ Now before you say I’ m just a sorry drunkard
		let me state my
		case .As reliable employment overseeing is,
		it is no easy chore on the spirit.I say no man of conscious can take the lash to another human day in and day out without shredding at his own self.Takes him to a place where he either makes excuses within his mind to be unaffected,
		or he finds some way to trample his guilty sensations.I trampled with frequency.I gave in to taste in wealth and prosperity.Such a profitable outcomes reserved
		for plantation masters.It’ s on the lot of us to serve.Now all I want,
		is to earn a decent wage,
		and get home.”

		Bass & amp;Epps“ What’ s Funny ? ”
		Epps I merely mean to finish the work at hand.As requested and as paid
		for.“Something rubs you wrongly,
		I offer the opportunity to speak on it.”
		You ask plainly so I will tell you plainly,
		what amused me just then was your concern
		for my well being in this heat.When quite frankly the condition of your laborers… it is horrid.It’ s all wrong,
		all wrong Mr.Epps.“What the hell ? They ain’ t hired help.They’ re my property.”
		You say that with pride.“I say it as fact.”
		If this conversation concerns what is factual and what is not,
		then it must be said that there is no justice,
		no righteousness in this slavery.But you do open up an interesting question,
		what right have you to your niggas ? When you come down to the point.“What right ? I bought em.I paid
		for em’.”
		Of course you did,
		and the law says you have a right to hold a nigger.But beggin’ the laws pardon in lies,
		suppose they pass a law taking away your liberty ? Making you a slave ? Suppose.“That ain’ t a supposable
		case .”
		Laws change,
		Epps.Universal truths are constant.It is a fact,
		a plain and simple fact,
		that what is true and right is true and right
		for all.White and black alike.“You callin me a nigger,
		Bass ? ”
		I’ m only asking in the eyes of god what is the difference ? “You might as well ask what the difference is between a white man and a baboon.I seen one of those critters in Orleans know just as much as any nigger I got.”
		Listen Epps,
		these niggers are human beings.If they are allowed to climb no higher than brute animals,
		you and men like you will have to answer
		for it.There is an ill Mr.Epps.A fearful ill resting upon this nation,
		and there will be a day of reckoning yet.“You like to hear yourself talk bass.Better than any man I know of .You’ d argue that black was white,
		or white / black.If anybody’ d contradict you ? Fine supposition
		if you live upon Yankees in New England,
		but you don’ t.You most surely do not.”

		Solomon & amp;Eliza
		After Solomon is gifted a violin by Ford,
		he shouts at Eliza to stop crying.“You
		let yourself drown in sorrow, and you will be overcome by it.”
		Have you stopped crying
		for your children.You make no sounds but will you ever
		let them go in your heart ? “They are as my flesh”
		Then who is distressed ? Do I upset the master and the mistress ? Do you care less about my loss than their well being ? “Master Ford is a decent man”
		He is a slaver.“Under the circumstances”
		Under the circumstances he is a slaver.Will you truckle at his boot ? “No”
		You luxuriate in his favor.“I survive.I will not fall into despair.I will offer up my talents to master ford.I will keep myself hearty till freedom is opportune.”
		So Ford is your opportunity ? You think he does not know that you are more than you suggest.But he does nothing
		for you.Nothing.You are no better than prized livestock.Call
		for him.Call.Tell him of your previous circumstances and see what it earns you Solomon.So you settling into your role as Platt then ? “My back is thick with scars from protesting my freedom.Do not accuse me.”
		I do not accuse you of nothing.I cannot accuse.I have done dishonorable things to survive and
		for
		all of them I have ended up here.No better than
		if I stood up by myself.God forgive me.Solomon
		let me weep
		for my children. <
		h2 > From the book < /h2>\
		"At length, as they were dragging me towards the tree, Chapin, who had momentarily disappeared from the piazza, came out of the house and walked towards us. He had a pistol in each hand, and as near as I can now recall to mind, spoke in a firm, determined manner, as follows: “Gentlemen, I have a few words to say. You had better listen to them. Whoever moves that slave another foot from where he stands is a dead man. In the first place, he does not deserve this treatment. It is a shame to murder him in this manner. I never knew a more faithful boy than Platt. You, Tibeats, are in the fault yourself. You are pretty much of a scoundrel, and I know it, and you richly deserve the flogging you have received. In the next place, I have been overseer on this plantation seven years, and, in the absence of William Ford, am master here. My duty is to protect his interests, and that duty I shall perform. You are not responsible— you are a worthless fellow. Ford holds a mortgage on Platt of four hundred dollars. If you hang him he loses his debt. Until that is canceled you have no right to take his life. You have no right to take it any way. There is a law for the slave as well as for the white man. You are no better than a murderer.\"

		"At length, as they were dragging me towards the tree, Chapin, who had momentarily disappeared from the piazza, came out of the house and walked towards us. He had a pistol in each hand, and as near as I can now recall to mind, spoke in a firm, determined manner, as follows: “Gentlemen, I have a few words to say. You had better listen to them. Whoever moves that slave another foot from where he stands is a dead man. In the first place, he does not deserve this treatment. It is a shame to murder him in this manner. I never knew a more faithful boy than Platt. You, Tibeats, are in the fault yourself. You are pretty much of a scoundrel, and I know it, and you richly deserve the flogging you have received. In the next place, I have been overseer on this plantation seven years, and, in the absence of William Ford, am master here. My duty is to protect his interests, and that duty I shall perform. You are not responsible— you are a worthless fellow. Ford holds a mortgage on Platt of four hundred dollars. If you hang him he loses his debt. Until that is canceled you have no right to take his life. You have no right to take it any way. There is a law for the slave as well as for the white man. You are no better than a murderer.\"

		Quotes:

			Armsby“ Now before you say I’ m just a sorry drunkard
		let me state my
		case .As reliable employment overseeing is,
		it is no easy chore on the spirit.I say no man of conscious can take the lash to another human day in and day out without shredding at his own self.Takes him to a place where he either makes excuses within his mind to be unaffected,
		or he finds some way to trample his guilty sensations.I trampled with frequency.I gave in to taste in wealth and prosperity.Such a profitable outcomes reserved
		for plantation masters.It’ s on the lot of us to serve.Now all I want,
		is to earn a decent wage,
		and get home.”

		Bass & amp;Epps“ What’ s Funny ? ”
		Epps I merely mean to finish the work at hand.As requested and as paid
		for.“Something rubs you wrongly,
		I offer the opportunity to speak on it.”
		You ask plainly so I will tell you plainly,
		what amused me just then was your concern
		for my well being in this heat.When quite frankly the condition of your laborers… it is horrid.It’ s all wrong,
		all wrong Mr.Epps.“What the hell ? They ain’ t hired help.They’ re my property.”
		You say that with pride.“I say it as fact.”
		If this conversation concerns what is factual and what is not,
		then it must be said that there is no justice,
		no righteousness in this slavery.But you do open up an interesting question,
		what right have you to your niggas ? When you come down to the point.“What right ? I bought em.I paid
		for em’.”
		Of course you did,
		and the law says you have a right to hold a nigger.But beggin’ the laws pardon in lies,
		suppose they pass a law taking away your liberty ? Making you a slave ? Suppose.“That ain’ t a supposable
		case .”
		Laws change,
		Epps.Universal truths are constant.It is a fact,
		a plain and simple fact,
		that what is true and right is true and right
		for all.White and black alike.“You callin me a nigger,
		Bass ? ”
		I’ m only asking in the eyes of god what is the difference ? “You might as well ask what the difference is between a white man and a baboon.I seen one of those critters in Orleans know just as much as any nigger I got.”
		Listen Epps,
		these niggers are human beings.If they are allowed to climb no higher than brute animals,
		you and men like you will have to answer
		for it.There is an ill Mr.Epps.A fearful ill resting upon this nation,
		and there will be a day of reckoning yet.“You like to hear yourself talk bass.Better than any man I know of .You’ d argue that black was white,
		or white / black.If anybody’ d contradict you ? Fine supposition
		if you live upon Yankees in New England,
		but you don’ t.You most surely do not.”

		Solomon & amp;Eliza
		After Solomon is gifted a violin by Ford,
		he shouts at Eliza to stop crying.“You
		let yourself drown in sorrow, and you will be overcome by it.”
		Have you stopped crying
		for your children.You make no sounds but will you ever
		let them go in your heart ? “They are as my flesh”
		Then who is distressed ? Do I upset the master and the mistress ? Do you care less about my loss than their well being ? “Master Ford is a decent man”
		He is a slaver.“Under the circumstances”
		Under the circumstances he is a slaver.Will you truckle at his boot ? “No”
		You luxuriate in his favor.“I survive.I will not fall into despair.I will offer up my talents to master ford.I will keep myself hearty till freedom is opportune.”
		So Ford is your opportunity ? You think he does not know that you are more than you suggest.But he does nothing
		for you.Nothing.You are no better than prized livestock.Call
		for him.Call.Tell him of your previous circumstances and see what it earns you Solomon.So you settling into your role as Platt then ? “My back is thick with scars from protesting my freedom.Do not accuse me.”
		I do not accuse you of nothing.I cannot accuse.I have done dishonorable things to survive and
		for
		all of them I have ended up here.No better than
		if I stood up by myself.God forgive me.Solomon
		let me weep
		for my children. <

		You say that with pride.“I say it as fact.”
		If this conversation concerns what is factual and what is not,
		then it must be said that there is no justice,
		no righteousness in this slavery.But you do open up an interesting question,
		what right have you to your niggas ? When you come down to the point.“What right ? I bought em.I paid
		for em’.”
		Of course you did,
		and the law says you have a right to hold a nigger.But beggin’ the laws pardon in lies,
		suppose they pass a law taking away your liberty ? Making you a slave ? Suppose.“That ain’ t a supposable
		case .”
		Laws change,
		Epps.Universal truths are constant.It is a fact,
		a plain and simple fact,
		that what is true and right is true and right
		for all.White and black alike.“You callin me a nigger,
		Bass ? ”
		I’ m only asking in the eyes of god what is the difference ? “You might as well ask what the difference is between a white man and a baboon.I seen one of those critters in Orleans know just as much as any nigger I got.”
		Listen Epps,
		these niggers are human beings.If they are allowed to climb no higher than brute animals,
		you and men like you will have to answer
		for it.There is an ill Mr.Epps.A fearful ill resting upon this nation,
		and there will be a day of reckoning yet.“You like to hear yourself talk bass.Better than any man I know of .You’ d argue that black was white,
		or white / black.If anybody’ d contradict you ? Fine supposition
		if you live upon Yankees in New England,
		but you don’ t.You most surely do not.”

		Solomon & amp;Eliza
		After Solomon is gifted a violin by Ford,
		he shouts at Eliza to stop crying.“You
		let yourself drown in sorrow, and you will be overcome by it.”
		Have you stopped crying
		for your children.You make no sounds but will you ever
		let them go in your heart ? “They are as my flesh”
		Then who is distressed ? Do I upset the master and the mistress ? Do you care less about my loss than their well being ? “Master Ford is a decent man”
		He is a slaver.“Under the circumstances”
		Under the circumstances he is a slaver.Will you truckle at his boot ? “No”
		You luxuriate in his favor.“I survive.I will not fall into despair.I will offer up my talents to master ford.I will keep myself hearty till freedom is opportune.”
		So Ford is your opportunity ? You think he does not know that you are more than you suggest.But he does nothing
		for you.Nothing.You are no better than prized livestock.Call
		for him.Call.Tell him of your previous circumstances and see what it earns you Solomon.So you settling into your role as Platt then ? “My back is thick with scars from protesting my freedom.Do not accuse me.”
		I do not accuse you of nothing.I cannot accuse.I have done dishonorable things to survive and
		for
		all of them I have ended up here.No better than
		if I stood up by myself.God forgive me.Solomon
		let me weep
		for my children. <
		h2 > From the book < /h2>\
		"At length, as they were dragging me towards the tree, Chapin, who had momentarily disappeared from the piazza, came out of the house and walked towards us. He had a pistol in each hand, and as near as I can now recall to mind, spoke in a firm, determined manner, as follows: “Gentlemen, I have a few words to say. You had better listen to them. Whoever moves that slave another foot from where he stands is a dead man. In the first place, he does not deserve this treatment. It is a shame to murder him in this manner. I never knew a more faithful boy than Platt. You, Tibeats, are in the fault yourself. You are pretty much of a scoundrel, and I know it, and you richly deserve the flogging you have received. In the next place, I have been overseer on this plantation seven years, and, in the absence of William Ford, am master here. My duty is to protect his interests, and that duty I shall perform. You are not responsible— you are a worthless fellow. Ford holds a mortgage on Platt of four hundred dollars. If you hang him he loses his debt. Until that is canceled you have no right to take his life. You have no right to take it any way. There is a law for the slave as well as for the white man. You are no better than a murderer.\"

			Hello,
			this is Mark Stouffer,
			one of the producers of the Phi - Fi podcast.Today I’ m doing a solo show to give you a little background on what Phi - Fi is,
			where it comes from,
			and where it’ s going.
			What is Phi - Fi ?
			Phi - Fi stands
			for philosophy fiction.It’ s shortened like sci - fi is
			for science fiction because philosophy fiction bears a close resemblance to sci - fi.In fact science fiction may have it’ s roots in philosophical writers.

			I had been watching a philosophically based sci - fi show and I wanted more.I kept watching sci - fi and was dissatisfied with what I was seeing.I thought about what I really wanted and realized that it was not the laser beams,
			or the robot costumes or even the advanced CGI that I was really watching
			for.It was the ideas,
			especially the ideas that could be abstracted out of what we might call mundane everyday life by placing theh in another world,
			or in another dimension.

			The show I had been watching,
			by the way,
			was the hit ABC TV show LOST,
			which had explicit references to philosophers and philosophical contexts,
			but was still listed as sci - fi,
			perhaps because it dealt with some kind of time travel.But,
			as in all good sci - fi,
			there was an underlying discussion about something much more compelling that made the story interesting.In one respect,
			finding out what that compelling and interesting subject mater is is what Phi - Fi.com is all about.

			It was only later that I discovered <!--more--> that this kind of philosophical subject matter is actually the source of sci-fi. The first sci-fi type of writers were actually philosophers presenting their abstract philosophical ideas, without wanting to explain the minutia of how it would be applied within a specific, contemporary real-world context. There is an excellent article on this at <a href=\"http://io9.gizmodo.com/5932802/the-philosophical-roots-of-science-fiction\">Gizmodo</a> which is linked in the show notes. Many people have suggested that Plato’s allegory of the cave is the prototype of a science fiction story, since it speculates about an unseen other world, which people have only seen the shadows of. The modern version of this story is The Matrix.
			When I was young I was attracted to the ancient Greeks and the idea of universalism in man’ s apprehension of reality.While recognizing that everyone is different in many ways,
			there are certain commonalities between all men.In fact there are certain facts about the world,
			and our life in it,
			that apply to all humans,
			alive or dead,
			and all humans who will ever live.Those common facts make all human life at least somewhat relatable and intelligible. <
			h2 > About the Island < /h2>
			That commonality provides a stable,
			inclusive,
			common ground,
			which is readily accessible to common everyday experience,
			from which to view philosophical ideas presented in film,
			and the rest of popular media.Film and television,
			in particular,
			have become very rich sources of philosophical content.Phi - Fi.com is here to help you digest that content into something useful to you.

			In our podcast we use the Island as a metaphor.In the shifting tides of a relativistic computer generated worlds portrayed in modern sci - fi,
			populated by time - traveling worm - holes,
			supernatural aliens,
			and mystical superpowers,
			we are going to find our way back down to earth,
			where we actually live.

			Taking a page out of LOST’ s storybook,
			we are going to use the island as a metaphor
			for the shared world we live in ,
			and more specifically,
			for the idea that we can only share a reality
			if there is a reality that exists.We are going to invite other philosophies,
			in the characters of other films,
			to take a walk on our island and to talk about the island itself and anything we find on it.The island represents the foundational concept that there is a reality,
			and that a belief is true to the extent that it corresponds to that reality,
			and we will even investigate that claim.In that way,
			the island metaphor will provide a philosophical basis from which to inspect other philosophical statements made in film.

			Other philosophical investigations of film,
			such as the many“ The Philosophy of ..”book reviews of film and television,
			will take the position that philosophical content must be investigated from a position of complete neutrality.Many philosophers have even stated this explicitly.In fact it is the dominant principle of modern philosophy.

			“The history of philosophy is the only philosophy that should be taught in a university.‘Systems’ philosophy are taught only by sects,
			or by individuals setting out to be prophets and to found a sect.I now have a system of philosophy which I hadn’ t dreamt of then,
			although the reasons
			for it lay all in me.But this system is not intended to found a sect,
			and will never do so,
			It aspires to be only a contribution to the humanities,
			an expression of a reflective,
			selective and free mind.”
			--George Santayana,
			“Persons and Places”

			We see that as floating adrift around the island,
			with no stable foundation to make any useful statements from.Philosophy is not about being infinitely pliable.It is about making actual statements about reality and our place in it.You can only truly judge a philosophy from a stationary position.You can’ t measure it
			while standing nowhere.To see it you must be,
			and to be is to be somewhere.

			On our island we stand.When we speak,
			we stand on our words.We don’ t just say them like,
			“perhaps someone thinks this.How can you say such a person is wrong ? ”This is false stance.We give away our position.In fact we pronounce it,
			so that it is pronounced,
			and leaves a pronounced impression.

			Because we are on a stable island we will also be able to build structures and operating system that support life and room
			for other people and societies.That is,
			after all,
			what philosophy is
			for,
			to provide a stable conceptual foundation on which to build your life.On our island of common ground philosophy is not just the plaything of intellectuals to chat over
			while trying to impress each other with their obscure intelligence.It is the operating system of the ideas that
			function in our everyday lives and that guide our choices and improve our world.

			Acknowledgments
			We would like to thank all our listeners who got is listed in the“ New and Noteworthy” section of iTunes.It was completely unexpected
			for us and quite a surprise to see so many people downloading the show.It helped us realize that the thing that interests us the most about modern popular media is the same thing that interests so many other people,
			and it redoubled our efforts to produce thought - provoking content.

			We are currently working on a review of “The Incredibles”,
			in which we have uncovered a new topic in philosophy,
			which we will explore in our discussion about superpowers.What are they and where do they come from ?

				Meta - Phi - Fi will be a recurring topic to discuss issues about the discussion.

			Hello,
		this is Mark Stouffer,
		one of the producers of the Phi - Fi podcast.Today I’ m doing a solo show to give you a little background on what Phi - Fi is,
		where it comes from,
		and where it’ s going.
		What is Phi - Fi ?
		Phi - Fi stands
		for philosophy fiction.It’ s shortened like sci - fi is
		for science fiction because philosophy fiction bears a close resemblance to sci - fi.In fact science fiction may have it’ s roots in philosophical writers.

		I had been watching a philosophically based sci - fi show and I wanted more.I kept watching sci - fi and was dissatisfied with what I was seeing.I thought about what I really wanted and realized that it was not the laser beams,
		or the robot costumes or even the advanced CGI that I was really watching
		for.It was the ideas,
		especially the ideas that could be abstracted out of what we might call mundane everyday life by placing theh in another world,
		or in another dimension.

		The show I had been watching,
		by the way,
		was the hit ABC TV show LOST,
		which had explicit references to philosophers and philosophical contexts,
		but was still listed as sci - fi,
		perhaps because it dealt with some kind of time travel.But,
		as in all good sci - fi,
		there was an underlying discussion about something much more compelling that made the story interesting.In one respect,
		finding out what that compelling and interesting subject mater is is what Phi - Fi.com is all about.

		It was only later that I discovered that this kind of philosophical subject matter is actually the source of sci - fi.The first sci - fi type of writers were actually philosophers presenting their abstract philosophical ideas,
		without wanting to explain the minutia of how it would be applied within a specific,
		contemporary real - world context.There is an excellent article on this at < a href = \"http://io9.gizmodo.com/5932802/the-philosophical-roots-of-science-fiction\">Gizmodo</a> which is linked in the show notes. Many people have suggested that Plato’s allegory of the cave is the prototype of a science fiction story, since it speculates about an unseen other world, which people have only seen the shadows of. The modern version of this story is The Matrix.
		When I was young I was attracted to the ancient Greeks and the idea of universalism in man’ s apprehension of reality.While recognizing that everyone is different in many ways,
		there are certain commonalities between all men.In fact there are certain facts about the world,
		and our life in it,
		that apply to all humans,
		alive or dead,
		and all humans who will ever live.Those common facts make all human life at least somewhat relatable and intelligible.

		That commonality provides a stable,
		inclusive,
		common ground,
		which is readily accessible to common everyday experience,
		from which to view philosophical ideas presented in film,
		and the rest of popular media.Film and television,
		in particular,
		have become very rich sources of philosophical content.Phi - Fi.com is here to help you digest that content into something useful to you.

		In our podcast we use the Island as a metaphor.In the shifting tides of a relativistic computer generated worlds portrayed in modern sci - fi,
		populated by time - traveling worm - holes,
		supernatural aliens,
		and mystical superpowers,
		we are going to find our way back down to earth,
		where we actually live.

		finding out what that compelling and interesting subject mater is is what Phi - Fi.com is all about.

		It was only later that I discovered that this kind of philosophical subject matter is actually the source of sci - fi.The first sci - fi type of writers were actually philosophers presenting their abstract philosophical ideas,
		without wanting to explain the minutia of how it would be applied within a specific,
		contemporary real - world context.There is an excellent article on this at < a href = \"http://io9.gizmodo.com/5932802/the-philosophical-roots-of-science-fiction\">Gizmodo</a> which is linked in the show notes. Many people have suggested that Plato’s allegory of the cave is the prototype of a science fiction story, since it speculates about an unseen other world, which people have only seen the shadows of. The modern version of this story is The Matrix.
		When I was young I was attracted to the ancient Greeks and the idea of universalism in man’ s apprehension of reality.While recognizing that everyone is different in many ways,
		there are certain commonalities between all men.In fact there are certain facts about the world,
		and our life in it,
		that apply to all humans,
		alive or dead,
		and all humans who will ever live.Those common facts make all human life at least somewhat relatable and intelligible.

		That commonality provides a stable,
		inclusive,
		common ground,
		which is readily accessible to common everyday experience,
		from which to view philosophical ideas presented in film,
		and the rest of popular media.Film and television,
		in particular,
		have become very rich sources of philosophical content.Phi - Fi.com is here to help you digest that content into something useful to you.

		In our podcast we use the Island as a metaphor.In the shifting tides of a relativistic computer generated worlds portrayed in modern sci - fi,
		populated by time - traveling worm - holes,
		supernatural aliens,
		and mystical superpowers,
		we are going to find our way back down to earth,
		where we actually live.

		Taking a page out of LOST’ s storybook,
		we are going to use the island as a metaphor
		for the shared world we live in ,
		and more specifically,
		for the idea that we can only share a reality
		if there is a reality that exists.We are going to invite other philosophies,
		in the characters of other films,
		to take a walk on our island and to talk about the island itself and anything we find on it.The island represents the foundational concept that there is a reality,
		and that a belief is true to the extent that it corresponds to that reality,
		and we will even investigate that claim.In that way,
		the island metaphor will provide a philosophical basis from which to inspect other philosophical statements made in film.

		Other philosophical investigations of film,
		such as the many“ The Philosophy of ..”book reviews of film and television,
		will take the position that philosophical content must be investigated from a position of complete neutrality.Many philosophers have even stated this explicitly.In fact it is the dominant principle of modern philosophy.

		“The history of philosophy is the only philosophy that should be taught in a university.‘Systems’ philosophy are taught only by sects,
		or by individuals setting out to be prophets and to found a sect.I now have a system of philosophy which I hadn’ t dreamt of then,
		although the reasons
		for it lay all in me.But this system is not intended to found a sect,
		and will never do so,
		It aspires to be only a contribution to the humanities,
		an expression of a reflective,
		selective and free mind.”
		--George Santayana,
		“Persons and Places”

		We see that as floating adrift around the island,
		with no stable foundation to make any useful statements from.Philosophy is not about being infinitely pliable.It is about making actual statements about reality and our place in it.You can only truly judge a philosophy from a stationary position.You can’ t measure it
		while standing nowhere.To see it you must be,
		and to be is to be somewhere.

		On our island we stand.When we speak,
		we stand on our words.We don’ t just say them like,
		“perhaps someone thinks this.How can you say such a person is wrong ? ”This is false stance.We give away our position.In fact we pronounce it,
		so that it is pronounced,
		and leaves a pronounced impression.

		Because we are on a stable island we will also be able to build structures and operating system that support life and room
		for other people and societies.That is,
		after all,
		what philosophy is
		for,
		to provide a stable conceptual foundation on which to build your life.On our island of common ground philosophy is not just the plaything of intellectuals to chat over
		while trying to impress each other with their obscure intelligence.It is the operating system of the ideas that
		function in our everyday lives and that guide our choices and improve our world.

			Hello,
		this is Mark Stouffer,
		one of the producers of the Phi - Fi podcast.Today I’ m doing a solo show to give you a little background on what Phi - Fi is,
		where it comes from,
		and where it’ s going.
		What is Phi - Fi ?
		Phi - Fi stands
		for philosophy fiction.It’ s shortened like sci - fi is
		for science fiction because philosophy fiction bears a close resemblance to sci - fi.In fact science fiction may have it’ s roots in philosophical writers.

		I had been watching a philosophically based sci - fi show and I wanted more.I kept watching sci - fi and was dissatisfied with what I was seeing.I thought about what I really wanted and realized that it was not the laser beams,
		or the robot costumes or even the advanced CGI that I was really watching
		for.It was the ideas,
		especially the ideas that could be abstracted out of what we might call mundane everyday life by placing theh in another world,
		or in another dimension.

		The show I had been watching,
		by the way,
		was the hit ABC TV show LOST,
		which had explicit references to philosophers and philosophical contexts,
		but was still listed as sci - fi,
		perhaps because it dealt with some kind of time travel.But,
		as in all good sci - fi,
		there was an underlying discussion about something much more compelling that made the story interesting.In one respect,
		finding out what that compelling and interesting subject mater is is what Phi - Fi.com is all about.

		It was only later that I discovered that this kind of philosophical subject matter is actually the source of sci - fi.The first sci - fi type of writers were actually philosophers presenting their abstract philosophical ideas,

		contemporary real - world context.There is an excellent article on this at < a href = \"http://io9.gizmodo.com/5932802/the-philosophical-roots-of-science-fiction\">Gizmodo</a> which is linked in the show notes.

The modern version of this story is The Matrix.
		When I was young I was attracted to the ancient Greeks and the idea of universalism in man’ s apprehension of reality.While recognizing that everyone is different in many ways,
		there are certain commonalities between all men.In fact there are certain facts about the world,
		and our life in it,
		that apply to all humans,
		alive or dead,
		and all humans who will ever live.Those common facts make all human life at least somewhat relatable and intelligible. <
		h2 > About the Island < /h2>
		That commonality provides a stable,
		inclusive,
		common ground,
		which is readily accessible to common everyday experience,
		from which to view philosophical ideas presented in film,
		and the rest of popular media.Film and television,
		in particular,
		have become very rich sources of philosophical content.Phi - Fi.com is here to help you digest that content into something useful to you.

		In our podcast we use the Island as a metaphor.In the shifting tides of a relativistic computer generated worlds portrayed in modern sci - fi,
		populated by time - traveling worm - holes,
		supernatural aliens,
		and mystical superpowers,
		we are going to find our way back down to earth,
		where we actually live.

		Taking a page out of LOST’ s storybook,
		we are going to use the island as a metaphor
		for the shared world we live in ,
		and more specifically,
		for the idea that we can only share a reality
		if there is a reality that exists.We are going to invite other philosophies,
		in the characters of other films,
		to take a walk on our island and to talk about the island itself and anything we find on it.The island represents the foundational concept that there is a reality,
		and that a belief is true to the extent that it corresponds to that reality,
		and we will even investigate that claim.In that way,
		the island metaphor will provide a philosophical basis from which to inspect other philosophical statements made in film.

		Other philosophical investigations of film,
		such as the many“ The Philosophy of ..”book reviews of film and television,
		will take the position that philosophical content must be investigated from a position of complete neutrality.Many philosophers have even stated this explicitly.In fact it is the dominant principle of modern philosophy.

		“The history of philosophy is the only philosophy that should be taught in a university.‘Systems’ philosophy are taught only by sects,
		or by individuals setting out to be prophets and to found a sect.I now have a system of philosophy which I hadn’ t dreamt of then,
		although the reasons
		for it lay all in me.But this system is not intended to found a sect,
		and will never do so,
		It aspires to be only a contribution to the humanities,
		an expression of a reflective,
		selective and free mind.”
		--George Santayana,
		“Persons and Places”

		We see that as floating adrift around the island,
		with no stable foundation to make any useful statements from.Philosophy is not about being infinitely pliable.It is about making actual statements about reality and our place in it.You can only truly judge a philosophy from a stationary position.You can’ t measure it
		while standing nowhere.To see it you must be,
		and to be is to be somewhere.

		On our island we stand.When we speak,
		we stand on our words.We don’ t just say them like,
		“perhaps someone thinks this.How can you say such a person is wrong ? ”This is false stance.We give away our position.In fact we pronounce it,
		so that it is pronounced,
		and leaves a pronounced impression.

		Because we are on a stable island we will also be able to build structures and operating system that support life and room
		for other people and societies.That is,
		after all,
		what philosophy is
		for,
		to provide a stable conceptual foundation on which to build your life.On our island of common ground philosophy is not just the plaything of intellectuals to chat over
		while trying to impress each other with their obscure intelligence.It is the operating system of the ideas that
		function in our everyday lives and that guide our choices and improve our world.

		We are currently working on a review of “The Incredibles”,

		Hello,
		this is Mark Stouffer,
		one of the producers of the Phi - Fi podcast.Today I’ m doing a solo show to give you a little background on what Phi - Fi is,
		where it comes from,
		and where it’ s going.
		What is Phi - Fi ?
		Phi - Fi stands
		for philosophy fiction.It’ s shortened like sci - fi is
		for science fiction because philosophy fiction bears a close resemblance to sci - fi.In fact science fiction may have it’ s roots in philosophical writers.

		I had been watching a philosophically based sci - fi show and I wanted more.I kept watching sci - fi and was dissatisfied with what I was seeing.I thought about what I really wanted and realized that it was not the laser beams,
		or the robot costumes or even the advanced CGI that I was really watching
		for.It was the ideas,
		especially the ideas that could be abstracted out of what we might call mundane everyday life by placing theh in another world,
		or in another dimension.

		The show I had been watching,
		by the way,
		was the hit ABC TV show LOST,
		which had explicit references to philosophers and philosophical contexts,
		but was still listed as sci - fi,
		perhaps because it dealt with some kind of time travel.But,
		as in all good sci - fi,
		there was an underlying discussion about something much more compelling that made the story interesting.In one respect,
		finding out what that compelling and interesting subject mater is is what Phi - Fi.com is all about.

		It was only later that I discovered <!--more--> that this kind of philosophical subject matter is actually the source of sci-fi. The first sci-fi type of writers were actually philosophers presenting their abstract philosophical ideas, without wanting to explain the minutia of how it would be applied within a specific, contemporary real-world context. There is an excellent article on this at <a href=\"http://io9.gizmodo.com/5932802/the-philosophical-roots-of-science-fiction\">Gizmodo</a> which is linked in the show notes. Many people have suggested that Plato’s allegory of the cave is the prototype of a science fiction story, since it speculates about an unseen other world, which people have only seen the shadows of. The modern version of this story is The Matrix.
		When I was young I was attracted to the ancient Greeks and the idea of universalism in man’ s apprehension of reality.While recognizing that everyone is different in many ways,
		there are certain commonalities between all men.In fact there are certain facts about the world,
		and our life in it,
		that apply to all humans,
		alive or dead,
		and all humans who will ever live.Those common facts make all human life at least somewhat relatable and intelligible. <
		h2 > About the Island < /h2>
		That commonality provides a stable,

		common ground,
		which is readily accessible to common everyday experience,
		from which to view philosophical ideas presented in film,
		and the rest of popular media.Film and television,
		in particular,
		have become very rich sources of philosophical content.Phi - Fi.com is here to help you digest that content into something useful to you.

		In our podcast we use the Island as a metaphor.In the shifting tides of a relativistic computer generated worlds portrayed in modern sci - fi,
		populated by time - traveling worm - holes,
		supernatural aliens,
		and mystical superpowers,

		and that a belief is true to the extent that it corresponds to that reality,

		Armsby“ Now before you say I’ m just a sorry drunkard
		let me state my
		case .As reliable employment overseeing is,
		it is no easy chore on the spirit.I say no man of conscious can take the lash to another human day in and day out without shredding at his own self.Takes him to a place where he either makes excuses within his mind to be unaffected,
		or he finds some way to trample his guilty sensations.I trampled with frequency.I gave in to taste in wealth and prosperity.Such a profitable outcomes reserved
		for plantation masters.It’ s on the lot of us to serve.Now all I want,
		is to earn a decent wage,
		and get home.”

		Bass & amp;Epps“ What’ s Funny ? ”
		Epps I merely mean to finish the work at hand.As requested and as paid
		for.“Something rubs you wrongly,
		I offer the opportunity to speak on it.”
		You ask plainly so I will tell you plainly,
		what amused me just then was your concern
		for my well being in this heat.When quite frankly the condition of your laborers… it is horrid.It’ s all wrong,
		all wrong Mr.Epps.“What the hell ? They ain’ t hired help.They’ re my property.”
		You say that with pride.“I say it as fact.”
		If this conversation concerns what is factual and what is not,
		then it must be said that there is no justice,
		no righteousness in this slavery.But you do open up an interesting question,
		what right have you to your niggas ? When you come down to the point.“What right ? I bought em.I paid
		for em’.”
		Of course you did,
		and the law says you have a right to hold a nigger.But beggin’ the laws pardon in lies,
		suppose they pass a law taking away your liberty ? Making you a slave ? Suppose.“That ain’ t a supposable
		case .”
		Laws change,
		Epps.Universal truths are constant.It is a fact,
		a plain and simple fact,
		that what is true and right is true and right
		for all.White and black alike.“You callin me a nigger,
		Bass ? ”
		I’ m only asking in the eyes of god what is the difference ? “You might as well ask what the difference is between a white man and a baboon.I seen one of those critters in Orleans know just as much as any nigger I got.”
		Listen Epps,
		these niggers are human beings.If they are allowed to climb no higher than brute animals,
		you and men like you will have to answer
		for it.There is an ill Mr.Epps.A fearful ill resting upon this nation,
		and there will be a day of reckoning yet.“You like to hear yourself talk bass.Better than any man I know of .You’ d argue that black was white,
		or white / black.If anybody’ d contradict you ? Fine supposition
		if you live upon Yankees in New England,
		but you don’ t.You most surely do not.”

		Solomon & amp;Eliza
		After Solomon is gifted a violin by Ford,
		he shouts at Eliza to stop crying.“You
		let yourself drown in sorrow, and you will be overcome by it.”
		Have you stopped crying
		for your children.You make no sounds but will you ever
		let them go in your heart ? “They are as my flesh”
		Then who is distressed ? Do I upset the master and the mistress ? Do you care less about my loss than their well being ? “Master Ford is a decent man”
		He is a slaver.“Under the circumstances”
		Under the circumstances he is a slaver.Will you truckle at his boot ? “No”
		You luxuriate in his favor.“I survive.I will not fall into despair.I will offer up my talents to master ford.I will keep myself hearty till freedom is opportune.”
		So Ford is your opportunity ? You think he does not know that you are more than you suggest.But he does nothing
		for you.Nothing.You are no better than prized livestock.Call
		for him.Call.Tell him of your previous circumstances and see what it earns you Solomon.So you settling into your role as Platt then ? “My back is thick with scars from protesting my freedom.Do not accuse me.”
		I do not accuse you of nothing.I cannot accuse.I have done dishonorable things to survive and
		for
		all of them I have ended up here.No better than
		if I stood up by myself.God forgive me.Solomon
		let me weep
		for my children. <
		h2 > From the book < /h2>\
		"At length, as they were dragging me towards the tree, Chapin, who had momentarily disappeared from the piazza, came out of the house and walked towards us. He had a pistol in each hand, and as near as I can now recall to mind, spoke in a firm, determined manner, as follows: “Gentlemen, I have a few words to say. You had better listen to them. Whoever moves that slave another foot from where he stands is a dead man. In the first place, he does not deserve this treatment. It is a shame to murder him in this manner. I never knew a more faithful boy than Platt. You, Tibeats, are in the fault yourself. You are pretty much of a scoundrel, and I know it, and you richly deserve the flogging you have received. In the next place, I have been overseer on this plantation seven years, and, in the absence of William Ford, am master here. My duty is to protect his interests, and that duty I shall perform. You are not responsible— you are a worthless fellow. Ford holds a mortgage on Platt of four hundred dollars. If you hang him he loses his debt. Until that is canceled you have no right to take his life. You have no right to take it any way. There is a law for the slave as well as for the white man. You are no better than a murderer.\"

		and the driver is crushed in the wreckage.Daniel leaves her in the back,
		to go
		for help.The man from the lobby hears the call,
		and after daniel is dazed from falling debris he suffers a
		case ofamnesia.The man in the lobby goes to rescue blake on a hunch that it may be her.

		Meanwhile on the roof.Emma Gains tries to hold it together amidst chaos.She attempts to tell people that a rescue will happen on the roof,
		but they ignore her and proceed to attempt an escape from the building downstairs.She is the sole rescue.

		Blake is stuck and the british bros show up to help pry the wreckage off with rebar.Blake tells the boys to get out and save themselves.However the older brother finds a jack,
		It jams,
		but Ben uses the rod to puncture the tires and lower the level of the vehicle.Allowing her escape.Was it altruistic,

		The pulse rates
		continue after the quake and Dr Lawrence Hayes and his crew recognize that the devastation will

		and relays it to her mother.In kind,
		the mother calls Daniel and leaves him a death threat.“Atta Girl”,

		Dr.explains a swarm event where the entire techtonic plate shifts.He says get out of SF or hold on tight.God be with you.

		Emma Gains:
			we didn’ t move on,
			we stopped moving.
			Ray Gaines : she’ s gone,
			your gone.What’ s the point ?
			Emma Gains : this is why i didn’ t stick around.

			I’ m assuming that the old man they help owned the airplane they take after trading the stolen truck.

			I know you didn’ t blame me.I just didn’ t know how to deal with malory’ s death.

			He took her rafting.He saw her die,
			and he remembers the moment when she realized that he wasn’ t going to be able to save her.

			I should have
			let you in .I just didn’ t know how.I’ m so sorry
			for how things ended with us.
			If you couldn’ t save our daughter,
			then nobody could have… Let’ s go get our daughter.

			Blake wears two of the same necklaces to remember her sister.They find a truck with emergency supplies.Nobody attempts to stop them or take what they have at the site
			while they scavange / loot.

			Younger bro appeals to Ben because of blake’ s experience.He then trusts her choice to seek high land.

			Ray Gaines does attempt to wrangle people to the side of the stadium,
			and caries an injured woman
			while a building collapses.The bleacher lights fall,
			and the dust shrouds the area.Nobody is injured.

			How did you know ? Just get up against something sturdy.Protect yourself.

			They decide to go around their environment by ocean.

			Blake removes a shard from Bens leg and covers the wound.They stagger on.

			Scientists remain safe in the lab.They must have found a secure location at CalTech

			How the fuck did the couple get a boat ?

				The tide is rising and falling.Ray Gaines recognizes a tsunami.Blake and bros receive emergency distress signal and sirens begin sounding.They rush to find safety.The tsunami is cresting,
			I thought those were Tidal Waves ? The tsunami is about to clear the golden gate of all through traffic.A large ship comes over the crest as their about to cross.

			Daniel is crushed on the bridge.

			Blake and Bros attmpt to find safety in the higher levels of the tsunami,
			and ultimately are safe at a level where the water isn’ t rising quick.It seems to stop.But then Ben says the level is rising.

			Blake cleans Bens wound.They signal
			for safety using a laser pointer.

			Blake sacrifices herself during the rescue.Ray Gaines cannot live with death of his other daughter,
			and he is determined to use all of his energy in saving her life.CPR is interrupted by the quake.Ray Gaines instructs Ben to
			break a window.Mom witnesses.And sees blake.She moves quickly into a position where she rams through the glass.Blake is saved after the all is lost moment.

			FEMA is super responsive and Gerraldo isn’ t even there talking about how black people are.

			Ray Gaines gave his daughter the tools to save herself and others.

			1 h 18 min | Documentary,
			Comedy,
			History | 12 November 2015(Germany)
			A documentary about how western films were smuggled into romainia during the rise of VHS

			Key Points
			Why did we pick a documentary
			for our first film,
			even though our focus is Philosophy in Fiction ?
			What is the film about ?
			How did contraband films change Romanian culture ? How does it compare to western culture from the same era ?
			How did Zamfir create and develop the film market ?
			In what ways does this film reflect media access on the internet today ?

			##How is this film related to Phi - Fi ?

			Phi - Fi is about the philosophical impact of fiction on our lives,
			and by philosophical I mean the core basis of knowledge about reality and our place in it.So this documentary touches on the importance of philosophy thought and conversation through the medium of drama.Drama provides moral and aesthetic use cases and a common knowledge narrative through which conversations can be worked through and common ground can be reached. <!--more-->

			The VCR Liberation in the U.S.had a later similar event in Soviet Romania.In the U.S.many small mom - and - pop shops opened up to sell the VCR tapes of popular movies.This market was big enough to put a VCR shop in every mini - mall and every major street in a town.The mom - and - pops in the U.S.existed in a new market that was mostly free and unregulated,
			so it was easy
			for many people to start up.Some people even started by selling the videos out of the back of their cars before opening a shop.

			In Soviet Romania they were not operating in a free market,
			but were instead in one of the most restrictive societies in the Soviet Union. <

			After the Chuck Norris biting the rat the man reflects : \"After the film ended\", and they show the boys having a mock fight outside at night, \"A street wasn\'t just a street. A rock wasn\'t just a rock. They were challenges. We started to play in a disciplined manner. We wanted to be... heroes\" and then they show the heroes from several western 80\'s films.

			The vision of the heroic we very important to children who were,
			as most children are,
			so continuously trying to become adults and learning how to do that.

			##
			The Fountain of Film

			The Western films became one of the most valuable commodities in Romania.It was what people traded their money in
			for,
			and it was what bureaucrats accepted as bribes,
			even top officials.Irina Nistor said it was“ my oxygen”,
			even after being confronted by secret police.She translated the films
			for years,
			not
			for the money,
			but
			for the chance to see all the films.

			Hollywood exports English speaking drama to every corner of the earth.It is probably part of the reason English is accepted as the international language of business,
			of air traffic control and other standards.

			Cheap,
			easily accessible drama with an American spirit was more popular worldwide than the British,
			French,
			and Russian products.Films are cultural products.

			##Zamfir as Capitalist

			He was not an imperialist.

			##Black Market Effect on Patrons of Film

			For most people viewing these movies,
			people couldn’ t emote
			while watching out of fear of who might be sitting right next to them.

			Kids were different,
			as they would see and then emulate Rocky.It sparked their imagination,
			and they began to play in a disciplined manner(play fighting).Preparing themselves to become the heroes they see in film.“A rock was no longer a rock,
			a street was no longer a street.”

			##Zamfir As Capitalist

			He was not an imperialist.He was just getting around invalid restrictions on trade.He wasn’ t trying to impose constraints on others.
			He was trying to provide people with a valuable product and make money off it.
			By profiting off videos he was also able to demonstrate that others could profit,
			and a small home theater industry developed.

			##Quotes
			State TV : “In Romania,
			Capitalism has lived its last day.The people are the true masters[...] of their destiny and the riches of the country.”
			TV went from broadcasting 20 hours a day on 2 channels to one 2 hour broadcast per day.
			It was said the cinema market had a film crisis,
			despite a huge appetite.

			Woman on Last Tango In Paris“ I couldn’ t believe a film like this could exist.”“That is when I realized how behind the west we were.”

			##Key Characters

			Irina Nistor - Film Narrator
			for State TV Ideological Commission
			Motivated to translate
			for Zamfir because censorship was not an issue
			Scenes had been censored
			for having too much food in the background,
			too many products.The people of Romania deal with lines
			for all commodities,
			yet there isn’ t enough.
			Negotiated her black market price at 100 LEI,
			the price of an Austrian chocolate bar.Zamfir offers her double @ 200 LEI.

			Zamfir - Engineer,
			Entrepreneur
			Described by Irina Nistor as : Stern,
			Pragmatic,
			Required Quickness
			Would bribe border patrol to smuggle VHS films.“Just like those who smuggle drugs and cigarettes throughout the world.”
			Said he was a coloniel but only a sergeant ?

			Mircea - 2 nd Narrator,
			Secret Police Agent

			Nicolae Ceaușescu was a Romanian Communist politician.He was General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party from 1965 to 1989. Pronounced Sheau - Shesku ","

			The indie game,
			Black Friday,
			is an ambitious attempt by Navid Khonsari and developers at INK Publishing to immerse their audience into a civil rebellion.Players take agency over the Character of Reza,
			son of an affluent conservative family,
			who must decide his path during the tipping point of the Iranian Revolution.

			The premise is unconventional to western audiences and that\ 's the game\'s allure. You assume the role of a photographer turned activist amidst a surging movement. Our character is influenced by family and friends who challenge his ideals of what\'s right and wrong in a country undergoing transformation. Will he choose to abandon the camera for more violent forms of protest? Will he fight to defend others from violence? Do his photos communicate a message of his choosing, or will the message be chosen for him? Does he have any say in where the movement is heading?

			From an analysis of the game\ 's mechanics, players find themselves largely stripped from being able to make decisions that allow much deviation in the game\'s outcomes. The mechanics end up being at odds with the game designer\'s intentions. To choose your own adventure. Revolution 1979: Black Friday promotes the ideal that in Iran during 1979 there were only two sides for an individual to choose. Support US allied dictator Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, or support socialist endorsed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. As an outsider to Islam, it\'s difficult to know who would be better when choosing between brutal dictators and supreme leaders. Is there a difference between those two titles? Perhaps developers could have considered a third possible option: Escape.

			<
			img src = \"http://phi-fi.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot-157-1-600x339.png\" alt=\"screenshot-157\" width=\"600\" height=\"339\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-239\" />

			There are several instances in the game where players are offered a choice of dialogue.Many times we are offered three types of similar answers framed with different attitudes.Our forth choice is to say nothing,
			and yet many times when that option is chosen our character is responded to like any other response.At what seems like crucial points in the game\ 's dialogue the option of silence is taken away entirely, and the player is left with three variations of the same answer. There is no option to abstain from the rebellion. You bought the ticket, and now you\'re on the ride.

			Quick time events are the height of action.Timed button presses follow the same sequence with every play through.We\ 're always ducking the same punch, or jumping over the same trashcan. Moving Reza through the streets of Tehran is like being on the guided track of some fun house roller coaster geared toward Islamic infotainment. It\'s a bit slow. Players are asked to take pictures of events along the street, and the game\'s photography mechanic involves scanning a needle as it swings like a pendulum across a light meter, while the frame moves in and out of focus. Like how real photographer\'s use cameras, right?

			<
			img src = \"http://phi-fi.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot-156-600x339.png\" alt=\"screenshot-156\" width=\"600\" height=\"339\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-242\" />

			When Reza takes a photo of something we can see real world equivalents to the Iranian Revolution along with captions meant to evoke empathy.One notable photo compared Muslim prayer in the street to the sit - ins held by blacks during the American Civil Rights movement.Another photo showed that the same booths propagating bootleg copies of pop albums were also valuable in disseminating the speeches of Khomeini.These factoids provide critical thinkers with more questions than facts.Is the Islamic theocratic takeover of Iran equivalent to American blacks protesting
			for the same level of service as their white counterparts ? What does it mean to show Western Pop consumerism as the vehicle
			for Socialist ideals ?

			The photography mechanic is particularly flimsy and acts mainly as a device to spread information to the player,
			which is ironic because being a photographer,
			and spreading information to others is the main focus of Reza\ 's character. If the player were to realistically take agency over the character of a photographer, it would be so that the player could choose what information to spread as a photographer does. To the contrary, quality of the player\'s photos and their ability to perform has little impact on the game\'s story. One could play the game without voluntarily taking a single photo. In one scene where police arrive to disband a protest, Reza is asked to photograph the event. If the player refuses, a photo will be taken for them, allowing a string of actions to take place in the story where revolutionaries use your photos without your consent to promote their agenda.

			<
			img src = \"http://phi-fi.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot-187-600x339.png\" alt=\"screenshot-187\" width=\"600\" height=\"339\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-243\" />

			There\ 's little skill to be developed and limited variations on what happens in the story, so are these features of an entertaining game with high replay-ability? Could it be that the main purpose of this game is to advertise the ideals presented to you? To get you to think like-minded when viewing \"the cause\", no matter what choices they provide to you?

			Reza is given different questions to answer in a conversation heading towards a single outcome.His perceived imprisonment becomes literal imprisonment,
			and he is destined by the writer\ 's of this game to become a martyr for the cause. The most important decision we get to make in this game\'s story results in choosing how we get to die. Will it be in the hands of our interrogator, or by the hands of our own brother in the secret police. Neither outcome bodes well feelings, a sense of accomplishment, or an ideal of how to succeed moving forward. All of which are things people hope to see as outcomes of a revolution. Unfortunately the mob might not be the way to individual success. 

			TL;DR | Sometimes a video game is little more than a veiled narrative.\
			"1979 Revolution: Black Friday\" would accurately fit such a depiction featuring a special knack for propaganda. With such a political charge attached to the narrative and few outcomes for players, it\'s difficult to deny a feeling of indoctrination throughout this game.",

				The premise is unique,
			unconventional and that\ 's the hook of the game\'s appeal. You assume the role of a photographer turned activist amidst a surging movement. Our character is influenced by family and friends to challenge his ideals of what\'s right and wrong in a country undergoing transformation. Will he choose to abandon the camera for more violent forms of protest? Will he fight to defend others from violence? Do his photos communicate a message of his choosing, or will the message be chosen for him? Does he have any say in where the movement is heading?

			From a perspective focusing on game mechanics,
			players find themselves largely stripped from being able to make decisions that allow much deviation in the game\ 's outcomes. The game\'s mechanics end up being at odds with the game designer\'s intentions. To choose your own adventure. Revolution 1979: Black Friday promotes the ideal that in Iran during 1979 there were only two sides for an individual to choose. Support capitalist endorsed dictator Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, or support socialist endorsed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Perhaps developers could have considered a third possible option: Escape.

			There are several instances in the game where players are offered a choice of dialogue.Many times we are offered three types of similar answers framed with different attitudes.Our forth choice is to say nothing,
			and yet many times when that option is chosen our character is responded to like any other response.At what would seem like crucial points in the game\ 's dialogue the option of silence is taken away entirely, and the player is left with three variations of the same answer. There is no option to abstain from the rebellion. You bought the ticket, and now you\'re on the ride.

			Quick time events are the height of action.Timed button presses follow the same sequence with every play through.We\ 're always ducking the same punch, or jumping over the same trashcan. Moving Reza through the streets of Tehran is like being on the guided track of some fun house roller coaster geared toward Islamic infotainment. It\'s a bit slow. Players are asked to take pictures of events along the street, and the game\'s photography mechanic involves scanning a needle as it swings like a pendulum across a light meter. You know, like how real photographer\'s use cameras. 

			When Reza takes a photo of something we can see real world equivalents to the Iranian Revolution along with captions meant to evoke empathy.One notable photo compared Muslim prayer in the street to the sit - ins held by blacks during the civil rights movement.Another photo showed that the same booths propagating bootleg copies of pop albums were also valuable in disseminating the speeches of Khomeini.These factoids provide critical thinkers with more questions than facts.Is Muslim prayer in the street equivalent to American blacks being offered the same level of service as their white counterparts ? Why are markets targeted by socialists when they provide a platform to espouse socialist ideals ?

			The photography mechanic is particularly flimsy and acts mainly as a device to spread information to the player,
			which is ironic because being a photographer is the main focus of Reza\ 's character. In fact, quality of the player\'s photos and their ability to perform has little impact on the games story. One could play the game without voluntarily taking a single photo. In one scene where police arrive to disband a protest, Reza is asked to photograph of the event. If the player refuses, a photo will be taken for them, allowing a string of actions to take place in the story.

			There\ 's little skill to be developed and limited variations on what happens in the story, so are these features of an entertaining game with high replay-ability?

			and he is destined by the writer\ 's of this game to become a martyr for the cause. The most important decision we get to make in this game\'s story results in choosing how we get to die. Will it be in the hands of our interrogator, or by the hands of our own brother in the SAVAK (secret police). Neither outcome bodes well feelings, a sense of accomplishment, or an ideal of how to succeed moving foward. All of which are things people hope to see as outcomes of a revolution. Unfortunately the mob might not be the way to success.

		"post_content": "<blockquote>Memory is a strange thing. It doesn\'t work like I thought it did. We are so bound by time. But now I\'m not so sure I believe in beginnings and endings.</blockquote>
		This is the first statement in Paramount Pictures\ "Arrival\". If you are looking for the philosophical direction the film is leading us in, you already have your answer.

		The statement is made in a dreamy,
		inner - voice - over which spans cuts to the scene in a style which has become trendy in \"groundbreaking\" thought-pieces. A slippery relationship between time and memory is the main theme of the film, but \"Arrival\" takes it one step beyond.

		“
		Arrival” is based on a short story by Ted Chiang called“ The Story of Our Lives”.This is a review of the film but we\ 'll briefly refer to the short story the film was based on because it has a deeper explanation of the central idea which wasn\'t fully explained in the film.

		It’ s billed as drama,
		mystery,
		sci - fi on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes,
		and that is fairly accurate since there is probably not enough science content to just call it sci - fi.Whatever science is in the film is directed towards one overt goal: to present a new idea.There is some discussion of a principle by which a person who learns a new language can develop the ability to see the world in from a special perspective,
		and that they may obtain new cognitive capacities.Language is taken as a limiting constraint in this story,
		and the new language is believed to provide new cognitive capabilities,
		even over the sequential nature of time,
		but that is something we will want to look at a little more closely than most reviews. <
		h2 id = \"revelations\">Revelations</h2>
		Visitors arrive from another place.That’ s about all we know about them,
		and that they are very advanced.They show up at will hovering over 12 almost random locations with the apparent intention of talking to people of the various nations and social strata of Earth.Their ships aren’ t shown arriving,
		so the title event of the film is taken as a given.They just show up there hovering and silent in cloud - piercing shell - shaped obelisks that hover without any detectable disturbance.

		The method of transportation and arrival establishes the alien beings as highly technologically advanced,
		but excuses the authors from specifying the nature of the advances.Even the entry portals to the ships are cleverly abstracted.The door disappears upward from the bottom,
		and then to avoid presenting any living quarters or internal walkways the gravity is manipulated in the bottom portal so that the humans can walk upright on the wall.When the alien beings are presented they are on the other side of a large glass wall suspended in what appears to be a milky fluid.It\ 's a very effective method of establishing the aliens as very advanced and inaccessible without getting caught up in technical details.

		The aliens,
		called heptapods
		for their seven legs,
		have the same basic form as octopus but with seven advanced tentacles from which they can dispense ink which they form into complex circular symbols.Each circular symbol has minor irregularities which are the content of the message.It is effectively a short sentence with the end of the sentence joined to the beginning.Whatever sci - fi space travel might be in this film is there solely to abstract out and present one single concept: The visitors have brought with them a payload which is carried in their language.The payload is the idea that the sequential nature of time is an illusion. <
			h2 id = \"the-theme\">The Theme</h2>
		The alien language is used as a portal to a special ability.A concept known as linguistic relativity,
		also called Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis,
		is a theory that the reality we experience is determined by the language we use.So as Louise learns a nonlinear language,
		one where sentences are circular and can be started at any point in the circle,
		her perception of time becomes non - linear.The film uses the strong interpretation of the Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis by showing that Louise actually overcomes the sequential nature of time by learning the new language.She remembers things that have not happened yet.

		I don\ 't subscribe to this idea but I\'m going to attempt to give it a full explanation. In this theory the future already exists and, if you know how, it is possible to access future occurrences by a process similar to remembering, but about the future. In this view of the world, the future is already there. It exists in the same way the past exists. The fact that we can\'t acquire knowledge of it just illustrates a limitation of our form of thinking. If we could use some other <em>thought process</em>, then we would be able to have cognitive access to future events as well as past events. Wouldn\'t that be cool?

		The
		case infavor of this idea was not presented very well in the movie so I was tempted to investigate the book version of the story where I found a better and more thorough presentation,
		so I am going to include that in this film review since it\ 's part of the original story and was probably left out of the film simply for time considerations.

		Ted Chiang is the author of \"The Story of Our Lives\", but he presents the case through the main character, Louise. She is narrating the <em>process of her discoveries</em> of the alien language. As she becomes adept at writing the language she is supposed to be gaining special insights into the way that the aliens think.

		For the future to be knowable in the same way the past is knowable,
		it must already exist.It must already be there like the later part of a book which you are reading,
		but which you have not gotten to yet,
		or of a film that you are in the middle of watching,
		but that has already been filmed.

		Chiang describes the already existing predetermined future as\ "The Book of Ages\" which, as he describes, must be without error. He anticipates some of the logical problems that such a book would entail, such as the conflict between the concepts of free will and predeterminism, but he presents it as a struggle to overcome the previously authored book of ages. <
		blockquote > Or,
		to be generous,
		some might say that the Book of Ages could exist,
		as long as it wasn’ t accessible to readers:
				that volume is housed in a special collection,
			and no one has viewing privileges. < /blockquote>
			He makes a compelling
		case as he has Louise describe some heartfelt moments in her life and the choices she made during them.

		Louise relates three sequences of events that overlap but that have similar qualities.Ian is interested in her sexually and she sees it coming,
		Ian\ 's and Louise\'s future daughter accidentally pulls a salad bowl from a shelf which falls on her head, and while Ian and her shop for clams at the local market she pulls a salad bowl off the shelf to purchase it. Chiang shows Louise recognizing the similarity between these three sequences as we see in the following dense passage: <
		blockquote > I reached out and took the bowl from the shelf.The motion didn’ t feel like something I was forced to do .Instead it seemed just as urgent as my rushing to
		catch
		the bowl when it falls on you:
				an instinct that I felt right in following.“I could use a salad bowl like this.”Ian looked at the bowl and nodded approvingly.“See,
			wasn’ t it a good thing that I had to stop at the market ? ”“Yes it was.”We got in line to pay
			for our purchases. < /blockquote>
			The three occurrences don\ 't feel predetermined, Louise tells us. They would only feel predetermined if we were predetermined to feel predetermined. But the author of the \"book of ages\" has written that we feel urgent. She feels urgency in her inevitable coupling with Ian, and with pulling the salad bowl off the shelf at the market. So why should she also not feel urgency when reaching out to protect her child\'s head? <
			h2 id = \"the-shell-game\">The Shell Game</h2>
			This is where the theory starts to fall down like the salad bowl upon the child\ 's head. Louise is not mating with Ian by any choice of her own, but because it is predetermined by the \"book of ages\" and she saw it in the future before it even happened. She had no choice in the matter. Even the urgency she may have felt was preprogrammed into her life as an automaton. We might as well call her Louise-bot.

			A drama / mystery film invests you in the struggles and discoveries of the story\ 's protagonist. This means we are concerned with the protagonists choices and the outcome of their choices. We are constantly asking if they made the right choice, like when Louise doffs her spacesuit in the alien vessel, and how that choice will affect their future.

			The story of the film is all about the sequential processes of discovery that the characters go through over a period of time,
			not knowing what the results will be until the results are revealed < em > in the future < /em>. The film requires that you watch from the beginning, otherwise it is not much of a mystery or drama.

			When we place a spoiler alert on films it is to indicate that
			if you know the outcome,
			especially that twist with General Shang,
			that the story will be\ "spoiled\". The value of the story is the process of it being told.

			The character Louise even stands her ground in the film when other characters ask her to change the order of the process she is using.They ask her to carry out her process out of order,
			in the same way that learning the result of a future action would be out of order,
			and she refuses.The character who overcomes the limitation of a sequential order of time is herself intensely protective of her sequential order of teaching the English language to the aliens.

			She is also adamant that discoveries made < em > before < /em> the aliens are properly taught are not real discoveries. She is saying this about aliens who, according the the main plot feature, already know the future. <
			blockquote > Purpose requires understanding of intent.Which means we have to find out
			if they make conscious choices of
			if their motivation is so instinctive they don\ 't understand a \"why\" question, and biggest of all, we need to have enough of a vocabulary with them so we understand their answer.<cite>Louise</cite></blockquote>
			Of course it is meaningless to talk about the\ "intent\" or \"motivation\" of entities which have no choice in their behavior, but it is also meaningless for Louise to talk about her own \"need\" and \"understanding\" if she acheives the predeterminism she and the film strive for.

			And it is not just the main character of the story who is protective of the sequential process.It is also the author of the screenplay :
				<
				blockquote > This movie was about process— the process of cracking a new language and teaching our own. < cite > Eric Heisserer < /cite></blockquote >
				The writer makes it clear that certain parts of the process must come in the right order,
			even though the entire conclusion of his film is that the sequential order of time is an illusion. <
			blockquote > I returned with the core question humanity wanted answered by the heptapods,
			written on a page.I dissected the question one word at a time in a defense of the need
			for basics.I realized how ridiculous I sounded: Here I was,
			defending a series of little scenes of a woman teaching alien life words like“ eat” and“ walk” and“ home.”But this movie is about process,
			and I was passionate about protecting Louise’ s process. < cite > Eric Heisserer < /cite></blockquote >
			This story of a language has been directed by a purpose,
			to show that by thinking differently we can acquire new abilities which are not possible to us as we think now.

			Louise acquires a special ability.By thinking in a new language she overcomes the limitations placed on her by human language.The inability to remember the future is supposed to be a constraint imposed on our minds by the way we speak.

			Yet,
			the same author that reveals this to us and wants to liberate us from the constraints of time that our language has imposed on us is intensely concerned with his character\ 's sequential process of development within the sequential telling of the story: <
			blockquote > In all my draft work on the adaptation,
			I spent the most time on the intellectual and political challenges of the story.But
			if I ever encroached on the intimate,
			emotional through - line of Louise’ s journey,
			the story fell apart.Other scenes could be sacrificed,
			reworked,
			moved,
			or cut to the bone.But director Denis Villeneuve and I found a bare minimum of steps to Louise’ s personal journey,
			and that became our Alamo;our hill we would die defending. < cite > Eric Heisserer < /cite></blockquote >
			In fact the main pay - off of the mystery,
			that Louise tells General Shang his wife\ 's dying words, doesn\'t even work if anyone else knew it in advance, that is to say if they knew it out of the order in which the author revealed it. If Shang could sometimes see things out of sequence he would have been entirely unimpressed. It is only surprising because it never actually happens anywhere all of recorded history.

			It is a mystical mechanism that only the author knows,
			by which he has granted a peek at the\ "book of ages\" to his protagonist while denying it to the rest of reality.

			But he still wants us to be invested in the twists and turns of the plot and await the outcome as he tells it so his story keeps us in some level of suspense and shocks us at the right time.

			Eric Heisserer shows great interest in technical processes,
			but that entire field of thinking is built on the sequence of cause and effect.He portrays that process admirably in the film.It is a process that depends on an orderly sequence of action,
			observation,
			and validation.

			That sequence would be meaningless
			if the premise of his film were true.Thoughts would float in and out of Louise\ 's mind and she would have no way of knowing if it was a memory of the past or of some time yet to come. She would not even know when she was. That is to say she would not know where in time she was. Is it now and hour after she put the clothes in the drier or a day after, or an hour before?

			It is interesting that authors often seem to have this view of an already authored future,
			but they don\ 't usually have it of an already authored book they are writing. If the future already exists then the book they are writing is already written. In such a case they would have no choice in the matter and no claim of authorship over the finished product. But that is not how they view the supposedly groundbreaking book or screenplay they are writing, only all the rest of reality, including the lives of others.

			Would an author pretend someone could know the future words other authors would write ? That seems like something too outrageous even
			for authors of time travel and I don\ 't think I\'ve ever seen an example of it. But if ordinary people\'s actions can be written in the supposed \"book of ages\", why not the works of authors?

			The author of the story negates the choices of all future authors.It\ 's like a partial solipsism where he imagines he is reading a book which they cannot read. He can read the future and then asks moot questions like \"If you could see your whole life from start to finish, would you change things?\" Of course you wouldn\'t. You would be preprogrammed not to even want to.

			The result of such a way of thinking is illustrated by a line from the film.Louise writes to her future daughter about the girl\ 's father\'s departure, \"I just told him something he wasn\'t ready to hear, It had to do with a really rare disease, and it\'s unstoppable. Kind of like you with your poetry and art.\" The daughter\'s life, and her poetry and art and a salad bowl falling on her head are all unstoppable, just like a disease. Her daughter has no choices either. It has all been preprogrammed and authored by another.

			It\ 's interresting that another popular drama, HBO\'s \"Westworld\", revolves entirely around the injustice of the very same time of predetermined, other-authored automaton life that \"Arrival\" authors happily bestow upon their protagonist and everyone she loves. The unjust nightmare Westworld\'s protagonists are struggling against is the blissful payoff of \"Arrival\". <
			h2 id = \"the-ideas\">The Ideas</h2>
			Some might say that this is too much analysis,
			that the film is entertainment.This is where the Phi - Fi project disagrees.Whereas\ "Arrival\" makes the case that the language we learn determines our reality, Phi-Fi is built on the contention that it is the meaning of the words we say and communicate, and that we hold to be true in our minds, that affect our perception of reality.

			The film makes the popular
		case that ideas are not as important as societal structures,
		such as language,
		and it presents that
		case ina sequence of ideas.The film has been translated into a variety of languages.Are it\ 's basic ideas different in each language? Or are the ideas contained in the words and sentences that the author actually wrote, instead of just the language he wrote them in?

		It is important
		for us to consider and validate the ideas the author presents.

		It seems much easier and more common in popular film to present the guiding agent of human action as DNA,
		such as all the zombie films,
		or social groups,
		or language,
		than ideas.This is probably because it is easier to use an idea about DNA or language than the idea of an idea.The idea of ideas adds a second level of abstraction.It is an abstraction of an abstraction,
		but no consequential.

		In the same way the author warns of the limitation that can be imposed on us by the language we speak in ,
		Phi - Fi warns of the limitations that can be imposed on us by the ideas we choose to accept. < /blockquote>","post_title": "Arrival (2016) Review","post_excerpt": "","post_status": "publish","comment_status": "open","ping_status": "open","post_password": "","post_name": "arrival-2016-review","to_ping": "","pinged": "","post_modified": "2017-01-22 18:51:27","post_modified_gmt": "2017-01-23 02:51:27","post_content_filtered": "","post_parent": 0,"guid": "http:/ / phi - fi.com / ? p = 213 ","

			Black Friday is an ambitious attempt by Navid Khonsari developers at INK Publishing to immerse their audience into a civil rebellion.Players take agency over the Character of Reza,
			son of an affluent conservative family,
			who must decide his path during the tipping point of the Iranian Revolution.

			The premise is unique,
			unconventional and that\ 's the hook of the game\'s appeal. You assume the role of a photographer turned activist amidst a surging movement. Our character is influenced by family and friends to challenge his ideals of what\'s right and wrong in a country undergoing transformation. Will he choose to abandon the camera for more violent forms of protest? Will he fight to defend others from violence? Do his photos communicate a message of his choosing, or will the message be chosen for him? Does he have any say in where the movement is heading?

			From a perspective focusing on game mechanics,
			players find themselves largely stripped from being able to make decisions that allow much deviation in the game\ 's outcomes. The game\'s mechanics end up being at odds with the game designer\'s intentions. To choose your own adventure. Revolution 1979: Black Friday promotes the ideal that in Iran during 1979 there were only two sides for an individual to choose. Support capitalist endorsed dictator Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, or support socialist endorsed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Perhaps developers could have considered a third possible option: Escape.

			There are several instances in the game where players are offered a choice of dialogue.Many times we are offered three types of similar answers framed with different attitudes.Our forth choice is to say nothing,
			and yet many times when that option is chosen our character is responded to like any other response.At what would seem like crucial points in the game\ 's dialogue the option of silence is taken away entirely, and the player is left with three variations of the same answer. There is no option to abstain from the rebellion. You bought the ticket, and now you\'re on the ride.

			Quick time events are the height of action.Timed button presses follow the same sequence with every play through.We\ 're always ducking the same punch, or jumping over the same trashcan. Moving Reza through the streets of Tehran is like being on the guided track of some fun house roller coaster geared toward Islamic infotainment. It\'s a bit slow. Players are asked to take pictures of events along the street, and the game\'s photography mechanic involves scanning a needle as it swings like a pendulum across a light meter. You know, like how real photographer\'s use cameras. 

			When Reza takes a photo of something we can see real world equivalents to the Iranian Revolution along with captions meant to evoke empathy.One notable photo compared Muslim prayer in the street to the sit - ins held by blacks during the civil rights movement.Another photo showed that the same booths propagating bootleg copies of pop albums were also valuable in disseminating the speeches of Khomeini.These factoids provide critical thinkers with more questions than facts.Is Muslim prayer in the street equivalent to American blacks being offered the same level of service as their white counterparts ? Why are markets targeted by socialists when they provide a platform to espouse socialist ideals ?

			The photography mechanic is particularly flimsy and acts mainly as a device to spread information to the player,
			which is ironic because being a photographer is the main focus of Reza\ 's character. In fact, quality of the player\'s photos and their ability to perform has little impact on the games story. One could play the game without voluntarily taking a single photo. In one scene where police arrive to disband a protest, Reza is asked to photograph of the event. If the player refuses, a photo will be taken for them, allowing a string of actions to take place in the story where revolutionaries use your photos without your consent to promote their ideals.

			There\ 's little skill to be developed and limited variations on what happens in the story, so are these features of an entertaining game with high replay-ability?

			Reza is given different questions to answer in a conversation heading towards a single outcome.His perceived imprisonment becomes literal imprisonment,

Will it be in the hands of our interrogator, or by the hands of our own brother in the SAVAK (secret police). Neither outcome bodes well feelings, a sense of accomplishment, or an ideal of how to succeed moving foward. All of which are things people hope to see as outcomes of a revolution. Unfortunately the mob might not be the way to success.

		"post_content": "\"Memory is a strange thing. It doesn\'t work like I thought it did. We are so bound by time. But now I\'m not so sure I believe in beginnings and endings.\"

		This is the first statement in the film.If you are looking
		for the philosophical insight the film is leading us to,
		you already have your answer.The statement is made in a dreamy,
		sing - song inner - voice voiceover which spans cuts to the scene.a slippery relationship between time and memory is the main theme of the film,
		but\ "Arrival\" takes it one step beyond.

		Paramount Pictures 2016 film“ Arrival” is based on a short story by Ted Chiang called“ The Stories of Our Lives”.This review is of the film,
		but I did read the short story it was based on to get a deeper understanding of the central idea which wasn\ 't fully explained in the film.

		It’ s billed as drama,
		mystery,
		sci - fi on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes,
		and that is fairly accurate.There is probably not enough science content to just call it sci - fi.Whatever science is in the film is directed towards one overt goal: to present a new idea.There is some discussion of a principle by which a person who learns a new language can develop the ability to see the world in from a special perspective,
		and that they may obtain new cognative capacities.Language is taken as a limiting constraint in this story,
		and the new language is believed to provide new cognitive capabilities,
		even over the sequential nature of time,
		but they run into a logical problem which we will
		return to.

		Visitors arrive from another place.That’ s about all we know about them,
		and that they are very advanced.They show up at will hovering over 12 almost random locations with the apparent intention of talking to people of the various nations and social strata of Earth.They ships aren’ t shown arriving,
		so the title event of the film is taken as a given.They just show up there hovering and silent in cloud - piercing shell - shaped obelisques that hover without any detectable disturbance.

		The method of transportation and arrival establishes the alien beings as highly technologically advanced,
		but excuses the authors from specifying the nature of the advances.Even the entry portals to the are cleverly abstracted.The door disappears upward from the bottom,
		and then to avoid presenting any living quarters or internal walkways the gravity is manipulated in the bottom portal so that the humans can walk upright on the wall.When the alien beings are presented they are on the other side of a large glass wall suspended in what appears to be a milky fluid.

		The aliens,
		called heptapods
		for seven - legged,
		have the same basic form as octopus but with seven advanced tentacles from which they can dispense ink which they form into complex circular symbols.Each circular symbol has minor irregularities which are the content of the message.It is effectively a short sentence with the end of the sentence joined to the beginning.Whatever sci - fi space travel might be in this film is there solely to abstract out and present one single concept: The visitors have brought with them a payload which is carried in their language.The payload is the idea that the sequential nature of time is an illusion.

		The alien language is used as a portal to a special ability.Linguistic relativity,
		also called Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis,
		is the theory that the reality we experience is determined by the language we use.So as Louise learns a nonlinear language,
		one where sentences are circular and can be started at any point in the circle,
		her perception of time becomes non - linear.The film uses the strong interpretation of the Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis by showing that Louise actually overcomes the sequential nature of time by learning the new language.She remembers the future.

		I don\ 't subscribe to this idea but I\'m going to attempt to give it a full explanation. The future already exists and, if you know how, it is possible to access future occurances by a process similar to remembering, but about the future. In this view of the world, the future already exists. It\'s already there. The fact that we can\'t acquire knowledge of it just illustrates a limitation with our form of thinking. If we could use some other thought process,then we would be able to have cognitive access to future events as well as past events. Wouldn\'t that be cool?

		//The case in favor of this idea was not presented very well in the movie so I was tempted to investigate the book version of the story where I found a better and more thorough presentation, so I am going to include that in this film review since it\'s part of the original story and was probably left out of the film simply for time considerations.

		//\"The book of ages\"

		Ted Chiang is the author,
		but he presents the
		case through the main character,
		Louise.She is narrating the process of her discoveries of the alien language.As she becomes adept at writing the language she is supposed to be gaining special insights into the way that the aliens think.

		There is the additional observation that even
		if you did know all about the future,
		and that something bad would happen in the future,
		you might not change any of choices you made in your life.For instance
		if you knew that your child would die of cancer at the age of 25 you might still choose to conceive and rear that child.

		For the future to be knowable,
		it must exist.It must already be there like the later part of a film or book which you are reading,
		but which you have not gotten to yet,
		or a film that you are in the middle of watching.

		It is interesting that authors often seem to have this view of an already authored future,
		but they don\ 't usually have it of an already authored book they are writing. If the future already exists then the book they are writing is already written. In such a case they would have no choice in the matter and no claim of authorship over the finneshed product. But that is not how they view the supposedly groundbreaking book or screenplay they are writing, only all the rest of reality, including the lives of others.

		Chiang reveals that this is how he views the future when he presents his argument against free will,
		or in favor of his theory of a predetermined free will.He describes the already existing predetermined future as\ "The Book of Ages\". He anticipates some of the logical problems that such a book would entail, such as the conflict between the concepts of free will and predeterminism, but he presents it as a struggle to overcome the previously authored book of ages.

		Or,
		to be generous,
		some might say that the Book of Ages could exist,
		as long as it wasn’ t accessible to readers:
				that volume is housed in a special collection,
			and no one has viewing privileges.

			Louise describes three sequences of events that overlap but that have similar qualities.Gary is interested in her sexually and she sees it coming,
			Gary\ 's and her future daughter accidently pulls a salad bowl from a shelf which falls on her head, and while Gary and her shop for clams at the local market she pulls a salad bowl off the shelf to purchase it. Chiang shows Louise recognizing the similarity betweeen these three sequences as we see in the following dense passage:

			I reached out and took the bowl from the shelf.The motion didn’ t feel like something I was forced to do .Instead it seemed just as urgent as my rushing to
			catch
			the bowl when it falls on you: an instinct that I felt right in following.“I could use a salad bowl like this.”Gary looked at the bowl and nodded approvingly.“See,
			wasn’ t it a good thing that I had to stop at the market ? ”“Yes it was.”We got in line to pay
			for our purchases.

				Black Friday is an ambitious attempt by Navid Khonsari developers at INK Publishing to immerse their audience into a civil rebellion.Players take agency over the Character of Reza,
			son of an affluent conservative family,
			who must decide his path during the tipping point of the Iranian Revolution.

			The premise is unique,
			unconventional and that\ 's the hook of the game\'s appeal. You assume the role of a photographer turned activist amidst a surging movement. Our character is influenced by family and friends to challenge his ideals of what\'s right and wrong in a country undergoing transformation. Will he choose to abandon the camera for more violent forms of protest? Will he fight to defend others from violence? Do his photos communicate a message of his choosing, or will the message be chosen for him? Does he have any say in where the movement is heading?

			From a perspective focusing on game mechanics,
			players find themselves largely stripped from being able to make decisions that allow much deviation in the game\ 's outcomes. The game\'s mechanics end up being at odds with the game designer\'s intentions. To choose your own adventure. Revolution 1979: Black Friday promotes the ideal that in Iran during 1979 there were only two sides for an individual to choose. Support US allied dictator Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, or support socialist endorsed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Perhaps developers could have considered a third possible option: Escape.


			There are several instances in the game where players are offered a choice of dialogue.Many times we are offered three types of similar answers framed with different attitudes.Our forth choice is to say nothing,
			and yet many times when that option is chosen our character is responded to like any other response.At what would seem like crucial points in the game\ 's dialogue the option of silence is taken away entirely, and the player is left with three variations of the same answer. There is no option to abstain from the rebellion. You bought the ticket, and now you\'re on the ride.

			Quick time events are the height of action.Timed button presses follow the same sequence with every play through.We\ 're always ducking the same punch, or jumping over the same trashcan. Moving Reza through the streets of Tehran is like being on the guided track of some fun house roller coaster geared toward Islamic infotainment. It\'s a bit slow. Players are asked to take pictures of events along the street, and the game\'s photography mechanic involves scanning a needle as it swings like a pendulum across a light meter. You know, like how real photographer\'s use cameras.

		Black Friday is an ambitious attempt by Navid Khonsari developers at INK Publishing to immerse their audience into a civil rebellion.Players take agency over the Character of Reza,
		son of an affluent conservative family,
		who must decide his path during the tipping point of the Iranian Revolution.

		The premise is unique,
		unconventional and that\ 's the hook of the game\'s appeal. You assume the role of a photographer turned activist amidst a surging movement. Our character is influenced by family and friends to challenge his ideals of what\'s right and wrong in a country undergoing transformation. Will he choose to abandon the camera for more violent forms of protest? Will he fight to defend others from violence? Do his photos communicate a message of his choosing, or will the message be chosen for him? Does he have any say in where the movement is heading?

		From a perspective focusing on game mechanics,
		players find themselves largely stripped from being able to make decisions that allow much deviation in the game\ 's outcomes. The game\'s mechanics end up being at odds with the game designer\'s intentions. To choose your own adventure. Revolution 1979: Black Friday promotes the ideal that in Iran during 1979 there were only two sides for an individual to choose. Support US allied dictator Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, or support socialist endorsed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Perhaps developers could have considered a third possible option: Escape.


		There are several instances in the game where players are offered a choice of dialogue.Many times we are offered three types of similar answers framed with different attitudes.Our forth choice is to say nothing,
		and yet many times when that option is chosen our character is responded to like any other response.At what seems like crucial points in the game\ 's dialogue the option of silence is taken away entirely, and the player is left with three variations of the same answer. There is no option to abstain from the rebellion. You bought the ticket, and now you\'re on the ride.

		Quick time events are the height of action.Timed button presses follow the same sequence with every play through.We\ 're always ducking the same punch, or jumping over the same trashcan. Moving Reza through the streets of Tehran is like being on the guided track of some fun house roller coaster geared toward Islamic infotainment. It\'s a bit slow. Players are asked to take pictures of events along the street, and the game\'s photography mechanic involves scanning a needle as it swings like a pendulum across a light meter. You know, like how real photographer\'s use cameras.

		The photography mechanic is particularly flimsy and acts mainly as a device to spread information to the player,
		which is ironic because being a photographer,
		and spreading information to others,
		is the main focus of Reza\ 's character. To the contrary, quality of the player\'s photos and their ability to perform has little impact on the game\'s story. One could play the game without voluntarily taking a single photo. In one scene where police arrive to disband a protest, Reza is asked to photograph of the event. If the player refuses, a photo will be taken for them, allowing a string of actions to take place in the story where revolutionaries use your photos without your consent to promote their ideals.

		"post_content": "\"Memory is a strange thing. It doesn\'t work like I thought it did. We are so bound by time. But now I\'m not so sure I believe in beginnings and endings.\"

		This is the first statement in the film.If you are looking
		for the philosophical insight the film is leading us to,
		you already have your answer.The statement is made in a dreamy,
		sing - song inner - voice voiceover which spans cuts to the scene.a slippery relationship between time and memory is the main theme of the film,
		but\ "Arrival\" takes it one step beyond.

		Paramount Pictures 2016 film“ Arrival” is based on a short story by Ted Chiang called“ The Stories of Our Lives”.This review is of the film,
		but I did read the short story it was based on to get a deeper understanding of the central idea which wasn\ 't fully explained in the film.

		It’ s billed as drama,
		mystery,
		sci - fi on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes,
		and that is fairly accurate.There is probably not enough science content to just call it sci - fi.Whatever science is in the film is directed towards one overt goal: to present a new idea.There is some discussion of a principle by which a person who learns a new language can develop the ability to see the world in from a special perspective,
		and that they may obtain new cognative capacities.Language is taken as a limiting constraint in this story,
		and the new language is believed to provide new cognitive capabilities,
		even over the sequential nature of time,
		but they run into a logical problem which we will
		return to.

		Visitors arrive from another place.That’ s about all we know about them,
		and that they are very advanced.They show up at will hovering over 12 almost random locations with the apparent intention of talking to people of the various nations and social strata of Earth.They ships aren’ t shown arriving,
		so the title event of the film is taken as a given.They just show up there hovering and silent in cloud - piercing shell - shaped obelisques that hover without any detectable disturbance.

		The method of transportation and arrival establishes the alien beings as highly technologically advanced,
		but excuses the authors from specifying the nature of the advances.Even the entry portals to the are cleverly abstracted.The door disappears upward from the bottom,
		and then to avoid presenting any living quarters or internal walkways the gravity is manipulated in the bottom portal so that the humans can walk upright on the wall.When the alien beings are presented they are on the other side of a large glass wall suspended in what appears to be a milky fluid.

		The aliens,
		called heptapods
		for seven - legged,
		have the same basic form as octopus but with seven advanced tentacles from which they can dispense ink which they form into complex circular symbols.Each circular symbol has minor irregularities which are the content of the message.It is effectively a short sentence with the end of the sentence joined to the beginning.Whatever sci - fi space travel might be in this film is there solely to abstract out and present one single concept: The visitors have brought with them a payload which is carried in their language.The payload is the idea that the sequential nature of time is an illusion.

		The alien language is used as a portal to a special ability.Linguistic relativity,
		also called Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis,
		is the theory that the reality we experience is determined by the language we use.So as Louise learns a nonlinear language,
		one where sentences are circular and can be started at any point in the circle,
		her perception of time becomes non - linear.The film uses the strong interpretation of the Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis by showing that Louise actually overcomes the sequential nature of time by learning the new language.She remembers the future.

		I don\ 't subscribe to this idea but I\'m going to attempt to give it a full explanation. The future already exists and, if you know how, it is possible to access future occurances by a process similar to remembering, but about the future. In this view of the world, the future already exists. It\'s already there. The fact that we can\'t acquire knowledge of it just illustrates a limitation with our form of thinking. If we could use some other thought process,then we would be able to have cognitive access to future events as well as past events. Wouldn\'t that be cool?

		The
		case infavor of this idea was not presented very well in the movie so I was tempted to investigate the book version of the story where I found a better and more thorough presentation,
		so I am going to include that in this film review since it\ 's part of the original story and was probably left out of the film simply for time considerations.

		Ted Chiang is the author,
		but he presents the
		case through the main character,
		Louise.She is narrating the process of her discoveries of the alien language.As she becomes adept at writing the language she is supposed to be gaining special insights into the way that the aliens think.

		There is the additional observation that even
		if you did know all about the future,
		and that something bad would happen in the future,
		you might not change any of choices you made in your life.For instance
		if you knew that your child would die of cancer at the age of 25 you might still choose to conceive and rear that child.

		For the future to be knowable,
		it must exist.It must already be there like the later part of a film or book which you are reading,
		but which you have not gotten to yet,
		or a film that you are in the middle of watching.

		It is interesting that authors often seem to have this view of an already authored future,
		but they don\ 't usually have it of an already authored book they are writing. If the future already exists then the book they are writing is already written. In such a case they would have no choice in the matter and no claim of authorship over the finneshed product. But that is not how they view the supposedly groundbreaking book or screenplay they are writing, only all the rest of reality, including the lives of others.

		Chiang reveals that this is how he views the future when he presents his argument against free will,
		or in favor of his theory of a predetermined free will.He describes the already existing predetermined future as\ "The Book of Ages\". He anticipates some of the logical problems that such a book would entail, such as the conflict between the concepts of free will and predeterminism, but he presents it as a struggle to overcome the previously authored book of ages.

		<
		blockquote > Or,
		to be generous,
		some might say that the Book of Ages could exist,
		as long as it wasn’ t accessible to readers:
				that volume is housed in a special collection,
			and no one has viewing privileges. < /blockquote>

			Sentences are fragile.

			Depression is needing to go five steps and having to take 50 steps to get there.It\ 's the extra energy that will be required to do a simple task.

			I don\ 't subscribe to this idea but I\'m going to attempt to give it a full explanation. The future already exists and, if you know how, it is possible to access future occurances by a process similar to remembering, but about the future. In this view of the world, the future already exists. It\'s already there. The fact that we can\'t acquire knowledge of it just illustrates a limitation with our form of thinking. If we could use some other thought process,then we would be able to have cognitive access to future events as well as past events. Wouldn\'t that be cool?

			The
		case infavor of this idea was not presented very well in the movie so I was tempted to investigate the book version of the story where I found a better and more thorough presentation,
		so I am going to include that in this film review since it\ 's part of the original story and was probably left out of the film simply for time considerations.

		Ted Chiang is the author,
		but he presents the
		case through the main character,
		Louise.She is narrating the process of her discoveries of the alien language.As she becomes adept at writing the language she is supposed to be gaining special insights into the way that the aliens think.

		There is the additional observation that even
		if you did know all about the future,
		and that something bad would happen in the future,
		you might not change any of choices you made in your life.For instance
		if you knew that your child would die of cancer at the age of 25 you might still choose to conceive and rear that child.

		For the future to be knowable,
		it must exist.It must already be there like the later part of a film or book which you are reading,
		but which you have not gotten to yet,
		or a film that you are in the middle of watching.

		It is interesting that authors often seem to have this view of an already authored future,
		but they don\ 't usually have it of an already authored book they are writing. If the future already exists then the book they are writing is already written. In such a case they would have no choice in the matter and no claim of authorship over the finneshed product. But that is not how they view the supposedly groundbreaking book or screenplay they are writing, only all the rest of reality, including the lives of others.

		Chiang reveals that this is how he views the future when he presents his argument against free will,
		or in favor of his theory of a predetermined free will.He describes the already existing predetermined future as\ "The Book of Ages\". He anticipates some of the logical problems that such a book would entail, such as the conflict between the concepts of free will and predeterminism, but he presents it as a struggle to overcome the previously authored book of ages. <
		blockquote > Or,
		to be generous,
		some might say that the Book of Ages could exist,
		as long as it wasn’ t accessible to readers:

			"Memory is a strange thing. It doesn\'t work like I thought it did. We are so bound by time. But now I\'m not so sure I believe in beginnings and endings.\"

			This is the first statement in the film.If you are looking
			for the philosophical insight the film is leading us to,
			you already have your answer.The statement is made in a dreamy,
			sing - song inner - voice voiceover which spans cuts to the scene.A slippery relationship between time and memory is the main theme of the film,
			but Paramount Pictures film\ "Arrival\" takes it one step beyond.

			Paramount Pictures 2016 film“ Arrival” is based on a short story by Ted Chiang called“ The Stories of Our Lives”.This review is of the film,
			but I did read the short story it was based on to get a deeper understanding of the central idea which wasn\ 't fully explained in the film.

			It’ s billed as drama,
			mystery,
			sci - fi on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes,
			and that is fairly accurate.There is probably not enough science content to just call it sci - fi.Whatever science is in the film is directed towards one overt goal: to present a new idea.There is some discussion of a principle by which a person who learns a new language can develop the ability to see the world in from a special perspective,
			and that they may obtain new cognative capacities.Language is taken as a limiting constraint in this story,
			and the new language is believed to provide new cognitive capabilities,
			even over the sequential nature of time,
			but they run into a logical problem which we will
			return to.

			Visitors arrive from another place.That’ s about all we know about them,
			and that they are very advanced.They show up at will hovering over 12 almost random locations with the apparent intention of talking to people of the various nations and social strata of Earth.They ships aren’ t shown arriving,
			so the title event of the film is taken as a given.They just show up there hovering and silent in cloud - piercing shell - shaped obelisques that hover without any detectable disturbance.

			The method of transportation and arrival establishes the alien beings as highly technologically advanced,
			but excuses the authors from specifying the nature of the advances.Even the entry portals to the are cleverly abstracted.The door disappears upward from the bottom,
			and then to avoid presenting any living quarters or internal walkways the gravity is manipulated in the bottom portal so that the humans can walk upright on the wall.When the alien beings are presented they are on the other side of a large glass wall suspended in what appears to be a milky fluid.

			The aliens,
			called heptapods
			for seven - legged,
			have the same basic form as octopus but with seven advanced tentacles from which they can dispense ink which they form into complex circular symbols.Each circular symbol has minor irregularities which are the content of the message.It is effectively a short sentence with the end of the sentence joined to the beginning.Whatever sci - fi space travel might be in this film is there solely to abstract out and present one single concept: The visitors have brought with them a payload which is carried in their language.The payload is the idea that the sequential nature of time is an illusion.

			The alien language is used as a portal to a special ability.Linguistic relativity,
			also called Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis,
			is the theory that the reality we experience is determined by the language we use.So as Louise learns a nonlinear language,
			one where sentences are circular and can be started at any point in the circle,
			her perception of time becomes non - linear.The film uses the strong interpretation of the Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis by showing that Louise actually overcomes the sequential nature of time by learning the new language.She remembers the future.

			Black Friday is an ambitious attempt by Navid Khonsari developers at INK Publishing to immerse their audience into a civil rebellion.Players take agency over the Character of Reza,
			son of an affluent conservative family,
			who must decide his path during the tipping point of the Iranian Revolution.

			The premise is unique,
			unconventional and that\ 's the hook of the game\'s appeal. You assume the role of a photographer turned activist amidst a surging movement. Our character is influenced by family and friends to challenge his ideals of what\'s right and wrong in a country undergoing transformation. Will he choose to abandon the camera for more violent forms of protest? Will he fight to defend others from violence? Do his photos communicate a message of his choosing, or will the message be chosen for him? Does he have any say in where the movement is heading?

			From a perspective focusing on game mechanics,
			players find themselves largely stripped from being able to make decisions that allow much deviation in the game\ 's outcomes. The game\'s mechanics end up being at odds with the game designer\'s intentions. To choose your own adventure. Revolution 1979: Black Friday promotes the ideal that in Iran during 1979 there were only two sides for an individual to choose. Support US allied dictator Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, or support socialist endorsed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Perhaps developers could have considered a third possible option: Escape.


			There are several instances in the game where players are offered a choice of dialogue.Many times we are offered three types of similar answers framed with different attitudes.Our forth choice is to say nothing,
			and yet many times when that option is chosen our character is responded to like any other response.At what seems like crucial points in the game\ 's dialogue the option of silence is taken away entirely, and the player is left with three variations of the same answer. There is no option to abstain from the rebellion. You bought the ticket, and now you\'re on the ride.

			Quick time events are the height of action.Timed button presses follow the same sequence with every play through.We\ 're always ducking the same punch, or jumping over the same trashcan. Moving Reza through the streets of Tehran is like being on the guided track of some fun house roller coaster geared toward Islamic infotainment. It\'s a bit slow. Players are asked to take pictures of events along the street, and the game\'s photography mechanic involves scanning a needle as it swings like a pendulum across a light meter. You know, like how real photographer\'s use cameras.

			a href = \"http://phi-fi.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot-164.png\"><img src=\"http://phi-fi.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot-164-300x169.png\" alt=\"screenshot-164\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-216\" /></a>

			When Reza takes a photo of something we can see real world equivalents to the Iranian Revolution along with captions meant to evoke empathy.One notable photo compared Muslim prayer in the street to the sit - ins held by blacks during the civil rights movement.Another photo showed that the same booths propagating bootleg copies of pop albums were also valuable in disseminating the speeches of Khomeini.These factoids provide critical thinkers with more questions than facts.Is Muslim prayer in the street equivalent to American blacks protesting to be offered the same level of service as their white counterparts ? Why are markets targeted by socialists when they provide a platform to espouse socialist ideals ?

			The photography mechanic is particularly flimsy and acts mainly as a device to spread information to the player,
			which is ironic because being a photographer,
			and spreading information to others,
			is the main focus of Reza\ 's character. To the contrary, quality of the player\'s photos and their ability to perform has little impact on the game\'s story. One could play the game without voluntarily taking a single photo. In one scene where police arrive to disband a protest, Reza is asked to photograph of the event. If the player refuses, a photo will be taken for them, allowing a string of actions to take place in the story where revolutionaries use your photos without your consent to promote their ideals.

			There\ 's little skill to be developed and limited variations on what happens in the story, so are these features of an entertaining game with high replay-ability?

			Reza is given different questions to answer in a conversation heading towards a single outcome.His perceived imprisonment becomes literal imprisonment,
			and he is destined by the writer\ 's of this game to become a martyr for the cause. The most important decision we get to make in this game\'s story results in choosing how we get to die. Will it be in the hands of our interrogator, or by the hands of our own brother in the SAVAK (secret police). Neither outcome bodes well feelings, a sense of accomplishment, or an ideal of how to succeed moving forward. All of which are things people hope to see as outcomes of a revolution. Unfortunately the mob might not be the way to individual success.

		Black Friday is an ambitious attempt by Navid Khonsari developers at INK Publishing to immerse their audience into a civil rebellion.Players take agency over the Character of Reza,

As an outsider to Islam, it\'s difficult to know who would be better when choosing between the brutal dictators and supreme leaders. Is there a difference between those two titles?

Players take agency over the Character of Reza, son of an affluent conservative family, who must decide his path during the tipping point of the Iranian Revolution.

		The premise is unique,
		unconventional and that\ 's the hook of the game\'s appeal. You assume the role of a photographer turned activist amidst a surging movement. Our character is influenced by family and friends to challenge his ideals of what\'s right and wrong in a country undergoing transformation. Will he choose to abandon the camera for more violent forms of protest? Will he fight to defend others from violence? Do his photos communicate a message of his choosing, or will the message be chosen for him? Does he have any say in where the movement is heading?

		From a perspective focusing on game mechanics,
		players find themselves largely stripped from being able to make decisions that allow much deviation in the game\ 's outcomes. The game\'s mechanics end up being at odds with the game designer\'s intentions. To choose your own adventure. Revolution 1979: Black Friday promotes the ideal that in Iran during 1979 there were only two sides for an individual to choose. Support US allied dictator Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, or support socialist endorsed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. As an outsider to Islam, it\'s difficult to know who would be better when choosing between the brutal dictators and supreme leaders. Is there a difference between those two titles? Perhaps developers could have considered a third possible option: Escape.

		There are several instances in the game where players are offered a choice of dialogue.Many times we are offered three types of similar answers framed with different attitudes.Our forth choice is to say nothing,
		and yet many times when that option is chosen our character is responded to like any other response.At what seems like crucial points in the game\ 's dialogue the option of silence is taken away entirely, and the player is left with three variations of the same answer. There is no option to abstain from the rebellion. You bought the ticket, and now you\'re on the ride.

		Quick time events are the height of action.Timed button presses follow the same sequence with every play through.We\ 're always ducking the same punch, or jumping over the same trashcan. Moving Reza through the streets of Tehran is like being on the guided track of some fun house roller coaster geared toward Islamic infotainment. It\'s a bit slow. Players are asked to take pictures of events along the street, and the game\'s photography mechanic involves scanning a needle as it swings like a pendulum across a light meter. Like how real photographer\'s use cameras, right?

		When Reza takes a photo of something we can see real world equivalents to the Iranian Revolution along with captions meant to evoke empathy.One notable photo compared Muslim prayer in the street to the sit - ins held by blacks during the civil rights movement.Another photo showed that the same booths propagating bootleg copies of pop albums were also valuable in disseminating the speeches of Khomeini.These factoids provide critical thinkers with more questions than facts.Is Muslim prayer in the street equivalent to American blacks protesting to be offered the same level of service as their white counterparts ? Why are markets targeted by socialists when they provide a platform to espouse socialist ideals ?

		The photography mechanic is particularly flimsy and acts mainly as a device to spread information to the player,
		which is ironic because being a photographer,
		and spreading information to others,
		is the main focus of Reza\ 's character. If the player were to realistically take agency over the character of a photographer, it would be so that the player could choose what information to spread as a photographer does. To the contrary, quality of the player\'s photos and their ability to perform has little impact on the game\'s story. One could play the game without voluntarily taking a single photo.

		There are several instances in the game where players are offered a choice of dialogue.Many times we are offered three types of similar answers framed with different attitudes.Our forth choice is to say nothing,
		and yet many times when that option is chosen our character is responded to like any other response.At what seems like crucial points in the game\ 's dialogue the option of silence is taken away entirely, and the player is left with three variations of the same answer. There is no option to abstain from the rebellion. You bought the ticket, and now you\'re on the ride.

		Quick time events are the height of action.Timed button presses follow the same sequence with every play through.We\ 're always ducking the same punch, or jumping over the same trashcan. Moving Reza through the streets of Tehran is like being on the guided track of some fun house roller coaster geared toward Islamic infotainment. It\'s a bit slow. Players are asked to take pictures of events along the street, and the game\'s photography mechanic involves scanning a needle as it swings like a pendulum across a light meter. Like how real photographer\'s use cameras, right?

		When Reza takes a photo of something we can see real world equivalents to the Iranian Revolution along with captions meant to evoke empathy.One notable photo compared Muslim prayer in the street to the sit - ins held by blacks during the civil rights movement.Another photo showed that the same booths propagating bootleg copies of pop albums were also valuable in disseminating the speeches of Khomeini.These factoids provide critical thinkers with more questions than facts.Is Muslim prayer in the street equivalent to American blacks protesting to be offered the same level of service as their white counterparts ? Why are markets targeted by socialists when they provide a platform to espouse socialist ideals ?

		The photography mechanic is particularly flimsy and acts mainly as a device to spread information to the player,
		which is ironic because being a photographer,
		and spreading information to others,
		is the main focus of Reza\ 's character. If the player were to realistically take agency over the character of a photographer, it would be so that the player could choose what information to spread as a photographer does. To the contrary, quality of the player\'s photos and their ability to perform has little impact on the game\'s story. One could play the game without voluntarily taking a single photo. In one scene where police arrive to disband a protest, Reza is asked to photograph of the event. If the player refuses, a photo will be taken for them, allowing a string of actions to take place in the story where revolutionaries use your photos without your consent to promote their ideals.

		Black Friday is an ambitious attempt by Navid Khonsari developers at INK Publishing to immerse their audience into a civil rebellion.Players take agency over the Character of Reza,
		son of an affluent conservative family,
		who must decide his path during the tipping point of the Iranian Revolution.

		The premise is unique,
		unconventional and that\ 's the hook of the game\'s appeal. You assume the role of a photographer turned activist amidst a surging movement. Our character is influenced by family and friends to challenge his ideals of what\'s right and wrong in a country undergoing transformation. Will he choose to abandon the camera for more violent forms of protest? Will he fight to defend others from violence? Do his photos communicate a message of his choosing, or will the message be chosen for him? Does he have any say in where the movement is heading?

		From a perspective focusing on game mechanics,
		players find themselves largely stripped from being able to make decisions that allow much deviation in the game\ 's outcomes. The game\'s mechanics end up being at odds with the game designer\'s intentions. To choose your own adventure. Revolution 1979: Black Friday promotes the ideal that in Iran during 1979 there were only two sides for an individual to choose. Support US allied dictator Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, or support socialist endorsed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. As an outsider to Islam, it\'s difficult to know who would be better when choosing between the brutal dictators and supreme leaders. Is there a difference between those two titles? Perhaps developers could have considered a third possible option: Escape.

		When Reza takes a photo of something we can see real world equivalents to the Iranian Revolution along with captions meant to evoke empathy.One notable photo compared Muslim prayer in the street to the sit - ins held by blacks during the American Civil Rights movement.Another photo showed that the same booths propagating bootleg copies of pop albums were also valuable in disseminating the speeches of Khomeini.These factoids provide critical thinkers with more questions than facts.Is Muslim prayer in the street equivalent to American blacks protesting to be offered the same level of service as their white counterparts ? Why is capitalism targeted by socialists when markets provide a platform to espouse socialist ideals ?

		The photography mechanic is particularly flimsy and acts mainly as a device to spread information to the player,

		is the main focus of Reza\ 's character. If the player were to realistically take agency over the character of a photographer, it would be so that the player could choose what information to spread as a photographer does. To the contrary, quality of the player\'s photos and their ability to perform has little impact on the game\'s story. One could play the game without voluntarily taking a single photo. In one scene where police arrive to disband a protest, Reza is asked to photograph of the event. If the player refuses, a photo will be taken for them, allowing a string of actions to take place in the story where revolutionaries use your photos without your consent to promote their ideals.

		Black Friday is an ambitious attempt by Navid Khonsari developers at INK Publishing to immerse their audience into a civil rebellion.Players take agency over the Character of Reza,
		son of an affluent conservative family,
		who must decide his path during the tipping point of the Iranian Revolution.

		The premise is unconventional to western audiences and that\ 's the game\'s allure. You assume the role of a photographer turned activist amidst a surging movement. Our character is influenced by family and friends to challenge his ideals of what\'s right and wrong in a country undergoing transformation. Will he choose to abandon the camera for more violent forms of protest? Will he fight to defend others from violence? Do his photos communicate a message of his choosing, or will the message be chosen for him? Does he have any say in where the movement is heading?

		From a perspective focusing on game mechanics,
		players find themselves largely stripped from being able to make decisions that allow much deviation in the game\ 's outcomes. The game\'s mechanics end up being at odds with the game designer\'s intentions. To choose your own adventure. Revolution 1979: Black Friday promotes the ideal that in Iran during 1979 there were only two sides for an individual to choose. Support US allied dictator Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, or support socialist endorsed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. As an outsider to Islam, it\'s difficult to know who would be better when choosing between the brutal dictators and supreme leaders. Is there a difference between those two titles? Perhaps developers could have considered a third possible option: Escape.

		There are several instances in the game where players are offered a choice of dialogue.Many times we are offered three types of similar answers framed with different attitudes.Our forth choice is to say nothing,
		and yet many times when that option is chosen our character is responded to like any other response.At what seems like crucial points in the game\ 's dialogue the option of silence is taken away entirely, and the player is left with three variations of the same answer. There is no option to abstain from the rebellion. You bought the ticket, and now you\'re on the ride.

		Quick time events are the height of action.Timed button presses follow the same sequence with every play through.We\ 're always ducking the same punch, or jumping over the same trashcan. Moving Reza through the streets of Tehran is like being on the guided track of some fun house roller coaster geared toward Islamic infotainment. It\'s a bit slow. Players are asked to take pictures of events along the street, and the game\'s photography mechanic involves scanning a needle as it swings like a pendulum across a light meter, while the frame moves in and out of focus.

		Black Friday is an ambitious attempt by Navid Khonsari and developers at INK Publishing to immerse their audience into a civil rebellion.Players take agency over the Character of Reza,
		son of an affluent conservative family,
		who must decide his path during the tipping point of the Iranian Revolution.

		The premise is unconventional to western audiences and that\ 's the game\'s allure. You assume the role of a photographer turned activist amidst a surging movement. Our character is influenced by family and friends who challenge his ideals of what\'s right and wrong in a country undergoing transformation. Will he choose to abandon the camera for more violent forms of protest? Will he fight to defend others from violence? Do his photos communicate a message of his choosing, or will the message be chosen for him? Does he have any say in where the movement is heading?

		From an analysis of the game\ 's mechanics, players find themselves largely stripped from being able to make decisions that allow much deviation in the game\'s outcomes. The mechanics end up being at odds with the game designer\'s intentions. To choose your own adventure. Revolution 1979: Black Friday promotes the ideal that in Iran during 1979 there were only two sides for an individual to choose. Support US allied dictator Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, or support socialist endorsed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. As an outsider to Islam, it\'s difficult to know who would be better when choosing between brutal dictators and supreme leaders. Is there a difference between those two titles? Perhaps developers could have considered a third possible option: Escape.

		There are several instances in the game where players are offered a choice of dialogue.Many times we are offered three types of similar answers framed with different attitudes.Our forth choice is to say nothing,
		and yet many times when that option is chosen our character is responded to like any other response.At what seems like crucial points in the game\ 's dialogue the option of silence is taken away entirely, and the player is left with three variations of the same answer. There is no option to abstain from the rebellion. You bought the ticket, and now you\'re on the ride.

		Quick time events are the height of action.Timed button presses follow the same sequence with every play through.We\ 're always ducking the same punch, or jumping over the same trashcan. Moving Reza through the streets of Tehran is like being on the guided track of some fun house roller coaster geared toward Islamic infotainment. It\'s a bit slow. Players are asked to take pictures of events along the street, and the game\'s photography mechanic involves scanning a needle as it swings like a pendulum across a light meter, while the frame moves in and out of focus. Like how real photographer\'s use cameras, right?

		When Reza takes a photo of something we can see real world equivalents to the Iranian Revolution along with captions meant to evoke empathy.One notable photo compared Muslim prayer in the street to the sit - ins held by blacks during the American Civil Rights movement.Another photo showed that the same booths propagating bootleg copies of pop albums were also valuable in disseminating the speeches of Khomeini.These factoids provide critical thinkers with more questions than facts.Is the Islamic theocratic takeover of Iran equivalent to American blacks protesting
		for the same level of service as their white counterparts ? What does it mean to show Western Pop consumerism as the vehicle
		for Socialist ideals ?

		The photography mechanic is particularly flimsy and acts mainly as a device to spread information to the player,
		which is ironic because being a photographer,
		and spreading information to others,
		is the main focus of Reza\ 's character. If the player were to realistically take agency over the character of a photographer, it would be so that the player could choose what information to spread as a photographer does. To the contrary, quality of the player\'s photos and their ability to perform has little impact on the game\'s story. One could play the game without voluntarily taking a single photo. In one scene where police arrive to disband a protest, Reza is asked to photograph the event. If the player refuses, a photo will be taken for them, allowing a string of actions to take place in the story where revolutionaries use your photos without your consent to promote their agenda.

		"post_content": "\"Memory is a strange thing. It doesn\'t work like I thought it did. We are so bound by time. But now I\'m not so sure I believe in beginnings and endings.\"

		This is the first statement in the film.If you are looking
		for the philosophical insight the film is leading us to,
		you already have your answer.The statement is made in a dreamy,
		sing - song inner - voice voiceover which spans cuts to the scene.A slippery relationship between time and memory is the main theme of the film,
		but Paramount Pictures film\ "Arrival\" takes it one step beyond.

		Paramount Pictures 2016 film“ Arrival” is based on a short story by Ted Chiang called“ The Stories of Our Lives”.This review is of the film,
		but I did read the short story it was based on to get a deeper understanding of the central idea which wasn\ 't fully explained in the film.

		It’ s billed as drama,
		mystery,
		sci - fi on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes,
		and that is fairly accurate.There is probably not enough science content to just call it sci - fi.Whatever science is in the film is directed towards one overt goal: to present a new idea.There is some discussion of a principle by which a person who learns a new language can develop the ability to see the world in from a special perspective,
		and that they may obtain new cognative capacities.Language is taken as a limiting constraint in this story,
		and the new language is believed to provide new cognitive capabilities,
		even over the sequential nature of time,
		but they run into a logical problem which we will
		return to.

		Visitors arrive from another place.That’ s about all we know about them,
		and that they are very advanced.They show up at will hovering over 12 almost random locations with the apparent intention of talking to people of the various nations and social strata of Earth.They ships aren’ t shown arriving,
		so the title event of the film is taken as a given.They just show up there hovering and silent in cloud - piercing shell - shaped obelisques that hover without any detectable disturbance.

		The method of transportation and arrival establishes the alien beings as highly technologically advanced,
		but excuses the authors from specifying the nature of the advances.Even the entry portals to the are cleverly abstracted.The door disappears upward from the bottom,
		and then to avoid presenting any living quarters or internal walkways the gravity is manipulated in the bottom portal so that the humans can walk upright on the wall.When the alien beings are presented they are on the other side of a large glass wall suspended in what appears to be a milky fluid.

		The aliens,
		called heptapods
		for seven - legged,
		have the same basic form as octopus but with seven advanced tentacles from which they can dispense ink which they form into complex circular symbols.Each circular symbol has minor irregularities which are the content of the message.It is effectively a short sentence with the end of the sentence joined to the beginning.Whatever sci - fi space travel might be in this film is there solely to abstract out and present one single concept: The visitors have brought with them a payload which is carried in their language.The payload is the idea that the sequential nature of time is an illusion.

		The alien language is used as a portal to a special ability.Linguistic relativity,
		also called Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis,
		is the theory that the reality we experience is determined by the language we use.So as Louise learns a nonlinear language,
		one where sentences are circular and can be started at any point in the circle,
		her perception of time becomes non - linear.The film uses the strong interpretation of the Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis by showing that Louise actually overcomes the sequential nature of time by learning the new language.She remembers the future.

		I don\ 't subscribe to this idea but I\'m going to attempt to give it a full explanation. The future already exists and, if you know how, it is possible to access future occurances by a process similar to remembering, but about the future. In this view of the world, the future already exists. It\'s already there. The fact that we can\'t acquire knowledge of it just illustrates a limitation with our form of thinking. If we could use some other thought process,then we would be able to have cognitive access to future events as well as past events. Wouldn\'t that be cool?

		The
		case infavor of this idea was not presented very well in the movie so I was tempted to investigate the book version of the story where I found a better and more thorough presentation,
		so I am going to include that in this film review since it\ 's part of the original story and was probably left out of the film simply for time considerations.

		Ted Chiang is the author,
		but he presents the
		case through the main character,
		Louise.She is narrating the process of her discoveries of the alien language.As she becomes adept at writing the language she is supposed to be gaining special insights into the way that the aliens think.

		There is the additional observation that even
		if you did know all about the future,
		and that something bad would happen in the future,
		you might not change any of choices you made in your life.For instance
		if you knew that your child would die of cancer at the age of 25 you might still choose to conceive and rear that child.

		For the future to be knowable,
		it must exist.It must already be there like the later part of a film or book which you are reading,
		but which you have not gotten to yet,
		or a film that you are in the middle of watching.

		It is interesting that authors often seem to have this view of an already authored future,
		but they don\ 't usually have it of an already authored book they are writing. If the future already exists then the book they are writing is already written. In such a case they would have no choice in the matter and no claim of authorship over the finneshed product. But that is not how they view the supposedly groundbreaking book or screenplay they are writing, only all the rest of reality, including the lives of others.

		Chiang reveals that this is how he views the future when he presents his argument against free will,
		or in favor of his theory of a predetermined free will.He describes the already existing predetermined future as\ "The Book of Ages\". He anticipates some of the logical problems that such a book would entail, such as the conflict between the concepts of free will and predeterminism, but he presents it as a struggle to overcome the previously authored book of ages. <
		blockquote > Or,
		to be generous,
		some might say that the Book of Ages could exist,
		as long as it wasn’ t accessible to readers:

			The indie game,
			Black Friday,
			is an ambitious attempt by Navid Khonsari and developers at INK Publishing to immerse their audience into a civil rebellion.Players take agency over the Character of Reza,
			son of an affluent conservative family,
			who must decide his path during the tipping point of the Iranian Revolution.

			The premise is unconventional to western audiences and that\ 's the game\'s allure. You assume the role of a photographer turned activist amidst a surging movement. Our character is influenced by family and friends who challenge his ideals of what\'s right and wrong in a country undergoing transformation. Will he choose to abandon the camera for more violent forms of protest? Will he fight to defend others from violence? Do his photos communicate a message of his choosing, or will the message be chosen for him? Does he have any say in where the movement is heading?

			From an analysis of the game\ 's mechanics, players find themselves largely stripped from being able to make decisions that allow much deviation in the game\'s outcomes. The mechanics end up being at odds with the game designer\'s intentions. To choose your own adventure. Revolution 1979: Black Friday promotes the ideal that in Iran during 1979 there were only two sides for an individual to choose. Support US allied dictator Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, or support socialist endorsed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. As an outsider to Islam, it\'s difficult to know who would be better when choosing between brutal dictators and supreme leaders. Is there a difference between those two titles? Perhaps developers could have considered a third possible option: Escape.

			There are several instances in the game where players are offered a choice of dialogue.Many times we are offered three types of similar answers framed with different attitudes.Our forth choice is to say nothing,
			and yet many times when that option is chosen our character is responded to like any other response.At what seems like crucial points in the game\ 's dialogue the option of silence is taken away entirely, and the player is left with three variations of the same answer. There is no option to abstain from the rebellion. You bought the ticket, and now you\'re on the ride.

			Quick time events are the height of action.Timed button presses follow the same sequence with every play through.We\ 're always ducking the same punch, or jumping over the same trashcan. Moving Reza through the streets of Tehran is like being on the guided track of some fun house roller coaster geared toward Islamic infotainment. It\'s a bit slow. Players are asked to take pictures of events along the street, and the game\'s photography mechanic involves scanning a needle as it swings like a pendulum across a light meter, while the frame moves in and out of focus. Like how real photographer\'s use cameras, right?

			When Reza takes a photo of something we can see real world equivalents to the Iranian Revolution along with captions meant to evoke empathy.One notable photo compared Muslim prayer in the street to the sit - ins held by blacks during the American Civil Rights movement.Another photo showed that the same booths propagating bootleg copies of pop albums were also valuable in disseminating the speeches of Khomeini.These factoids provide critical thinkers with more questions than facts.Is the Islamic theocratic takeover of Iran equivalent to American blacks protesting
			for the same level of service as their white counterparts ? What does it mean to show Western Pop consumerism as the vehicle
			for Socialist ideals ?

			The photography mechanic is particularly flimsy and acts mainly as a device to spread information to the player,
			which is ironic because being a photographer,
			and spreading information to others is the main focus of Reza\ 's character. If the player were to realistically take agency over the character of a photographer, it would be so that the player could choose what information to spread as a photographer does. To the contrary, quality of the player\'s photos and their ability to perform has little impact on the game\'s story. One could play the game without voluntarily taking a single photo. In one scene where police arrive to disband a protest, Reza is asked to photograph the event. If the player refuses, a photo will be taken for them, allowing a string of actions to take place in the story where revolutionaries use your photos without your consent to promote their agenda.

			There\ 's little skill to be developed and limited variations on what happens in the story, so are these features of an entertaining game with high replay-ability? Could it be that the main purpose of this game is to advertise the ideals presented to you? To get you to think like-minded when viewing \"the cause\", no matter what choices they provide to you?

			Reza is given different questions to answer in a conversation heading towards a single outcome.His perceived imprisonment becomes literal imprisonment,
			and he is destined by the writer\ 's of this game to become a martyr for the cause. The most important decision we get to make in this game\'s story results in choosing how we get to die.

Neither outcome bodes well feelings, a sense of accomplishment, or an ideal of how to succeed moving forward. All of which are things people hope to see as outcomes of a revolution. Unfortunately the mob might not be the way to individual success.

		"post_content": "\"Memory is a strange thing. It doesn\'t work like I thought it did. We are so bound by time. But now I\'m not so sure I believe in beginnings and endings.\"

		This is the first statement in the film.If you are looking
		for the philosophical insight the film is leading us to,
		you already have your answer.The statement is made in a dreamy,
		sing - song inner - voice voiceover which spans cuts to the scene.A slippery relationship between time and memory is the main theme of the film,
		but Paramount Pictures\ "Arrival\" takes it one step beyond.

		Paramount Pictures 2016 film“ Arrival” is based on a short story by Ted Chiang called“ The Stories of Our Lives”.This review is of the film,
		but I did read the short story it was based on to get a deeper understanding of the central idea which wasn\ 't fully explained in the film.

		It’ s billed as drama,
		mystery,
		sci - fi on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes,
		and that is fairly accurate.There is probably not enough science content to just call it sci - fi.Whatever science is in the film is directed towards one overt goal: to present a new idea.There is some discussion of a principle by which a person who learns a new language can develop the ability to see the world in from a special perspective,
		and that they may obtain new cognative capacities.Language is taken as a limiting constraint in this story,
		and the new language is believed to provide new cognitive capabilities,
		even over the sequential nature of time,
		but they run into a logical problem which we will
		return to.

		Visitors arrive from another place.That’ s about all we know about them,
		and that they are very advanced.They show up at will hovering over 12 almost random locations with the apparent intention of talking to people of the various nations and social strata of Earth.They ships aren’ t shown arriving,
		so the title event of the film is taken as a given.They just show up there hovering and silent in cloud - piercing shell - shaped obelisques that hover without any detectable disturbance.

		The method of transportation and arrival establishes the alien beings as highly technologically advanced,
		but excuses the authors from specifying the nature of the advances.Even the entry portals to the are cleverly abstracted.The door disappears upward from the bottom,
		and then to avoid presenting any living quarters or internal walkways the gravity is manipulated in the bottom portal so that the humans can walk upright on the wall.When the alien beings are presented they are on the other side of a large glass wall suspended in what appears to be a milky fluid.

		The aliens,
		called heptapods
		for seven - legged,
		have the same basic form as octopus but with seven advanced tentacles from which they can dispense ink which they form into complex circular symbols.Each circular symbol has minor irregularities which are the content of the message.It is effectively a short sentence with the end of the sentence joined to the beginning.Whatever sci - fi space travel might be in this film is there solely to abstract out and present one single concept: The visitors have brought with them a payload which is carried in their language.The payload is the idea that the sequential nature of time is an illusion.

		The alien language is used as a portal to a special ability.Linguistic relativity,
		also called Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis,
		is the theory that the reality we experience is determined by the language we use.So as Louise learns a nonlinear language,
		one where sentences are circular and can be started at any point in the circle,
		her perception of time becomes non - linear.The film uses the strong interpretation of the Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis by showing that Louise actually overcomes the sequential nature of time by learning the new language.She remembers the future.

		I don\ 't subscribe to this idea but I\'m going to attempt to give it a full explanation. The future already exists and, if you know how, it is possible to access future occurances by a process similar to remembering, but about the future. In this view of the world, the future already exists. It\'s already there. The fact that we can\'t acquire knowledge of it just illustrates a limitation with our form of thinking. If we could use some other thought process,then we would be able to have cognitive access to future events as well as past events. Wouldn\'t that be cool?

		The
		case infavor of this idea was not presented very well in the movie so I was tempted to investigate the book version of the story where I found a better and more thorough presentation,
		so I am going to include that in this film review since it\ 's part of the original story and was probably left out of the film simply for time considerations.

		Ted Chiang is the author,
		but he presents the
		case through the main character,
		Louise.She is narrating the process of her discoveries of the alien language.As she becomes adept at writing the language she is supposed to be gaining special insights into the way that the aliens think.

		There is the additional observation that even
		if you did know all about the future,
		and that something bad would happen in the future,
		you might not change any of choices you made in your life.For instance
		if you knew that your child would die of cancer at the age of 25 you might still choose to conceive and rear that child.

		For the future to be knowable,
		it must exist.It must already be there like the later part of a film or book which you are reading,
		but which you have not gotten to yet,
		or a film that you are in the middle of watching.

		It is interesting that authors often seem to have this view of an already authored future,
		but they don\ 't usually have it of an already authored book they are writing. If the future already exists then the book they are writing is already written. In such a case they would have no choice in the matter and no claim of authorship over the finneshed product. But that is not how they view the supposedly groundbreaking book or screenplay they are writing, only all the rest of reality, including the lives of others.

		Chiang reveals that this is how he views the future when he presents his argument against free will,
		or in favor of his theory of a predetermined free will.He describes the already existing predetermined future as\ "The Book of Ages\". He anticipates some of the logical problems that such a book would entail, such as the conflict between the concepts of free will and predeterminism, but he presents it as a struggle to overcome the previously authored book of ages. <
		blockquote > Or,
		to be generous,
		some might say that the Book of Ages could exist,
		as long as it wasn’ t accessible to readers:
				that volume is housed in a special collection,
			and no one has viewing privileges. < /blockquote>

			"Memory is a strange thing. It doesn\'t work like I thought it did. We are so bound by time. But now I\'m not so sure I believe in beginnings and endings.\"

			This is the first statement in the film.If you are looking
			for the philosophical insight the film is leading us to,
			you already have your answer.The statement is made in a dreamy,
			sing - song inner - voice voiceover which spans cuts to the scene.A slippery relationship between time and memory is the main theme of the film,
			but Paramount Pictures\ "Arrival\" takes it one step beyond.

			“
			Arrival” is based on a short story by Ted Chiang called“ The Stories of Our Lives”.This review is of the film,
			but I did read the short story it was based on to get a deeper understanding of the central idea which wasn\ 't fully explained in the film.

			It’ s billed as drama,
			mystery,
			sci - fi on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes,
			and that is fairly accurate.There is probably not enough science content to just call it sci - fi.Whatever science is in the film is directed towards one overt goal: to present a new idea.There is some discussion of a principle by which a person who learns a new language can develop the ability to see the world in from a special perspective,
			and that they may obtain new cognative capacities.Language is taken as a limiting constraint in this story,
			and the new language is believed to provide new cognitive capabilities,
			even over the sequential nature of time,
			but they run into a logical problem which we will
			return to.

			Visitors arrive from another place.That’ s about all we know about them,
			and that they are very advanced.They show up at will hovering over 12 almost random locations with the apparent intention of talking to people of the various nations and social strata of Earth.They ships aren’ t shown arriving,
			so the title event of the film is taken as a given.They just show up there hovering and silent in cloud - piercing shell - shaped obelisques that hover without any detectable disturbance.

			The method of transportation and arrival establishes the alien beings as highly technologically advanced,
			but excuses the authors from specifying the nature of the advances.Even the entry portals to the are cleverly abstracted.The door disappears upward from the bottom,
			and then to avoid presenting any living quarters or internal walkways the gravity is manipulated in the bottom portal so that the humans can walk upright on the wall.When the alien beings are presented they are on the other side of a large glass wall suspended in what appears to be a milky fluid.

			The aliens,
			called heptapods
			for seven - legged,
			have the same basic form as octopus but with seven advanced tentacles from which they can dispense ink which they form into complex circular symbols.Each circular symbol has minor irregularities which are the content of the message.It is effectively a short sentence with the end of the sentence joined to the beginning.Whatever sci - fi space travel might be in this film is there solely to abstract out and present one single concept: The visitors have brought with them a payload which is carried in their language.The payload is the idea that the sequential nature of time is an illusion.

			The alien language is used as a portal to a special ability.Linguistic relativity,
			also called Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis,
			is the theory that the reality we experience is determined by the language we use.So as Louise learns a nonlinear language,
			one where sentences are circular and can be started at any point in the circle,
			her perception of time becomes non - linear.The film uses the strong interpretation of the Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis by showing that Louise actually overcomes the sequential nature of time by learning the new language.She remembers the future.

			I don\ 't subscribe to this idea but I\'m going to attempt to give it a full explanation. The future already exists and, if you know how, it is possible to access future occurances by a process similar to remembering, but about the future. In this view of the world, the future already exists. It\'s already there. The fact that we can\'t acquire knowledge of it just illustrates a limitation with our form of thinking. If we could use some other thought process,then we would be able to have cognitive access to future events as well as past events. Wouldn\'t that be cool?

			The
		case infavor of this idea was not presented very well in the movie so I was tempted to investigate the book version of the story where I found a better and more thorough presentation,
		so I am going to include that in this film review since it\ 's part of the original story and was probably left out of the film simply for time considerations.

		Ted Chiang is the author,
		but he presents the
		case through the main character,
		Louise.She is narrating the process of her discoveries of the alien language.As she becomes adept at writing the language she is supposed to be gaining special insights into the way that the aliens think.

		There is the additional observation that even
		if you did know all about the future,
		and that something bad would happen in the future,
		you might not change any of choices you made in your life.For instance
		if you knew that your child would die of cancer at the age of 25 you might still choose to conceive and rear that child.

		For the future to be knowable,
		it must exist.It must already be there like the later part of a film or book which you are reading,
		but which you have not gotten to yet,
		or a film that you are in the middle of watching.

		It is interesting that authors often seem to have this view of an already authored future,
		but they don\ 't usually have it of an already authored book they are writing. If the future already exists then the book they are writing is already written. In such a case they would have no choice in the matter and no claim of authorship over the finneshed product. But that is not how they view the supposedly groundbreaking book or screenplay they are writing, only all the rest of reality, including the lives of others.

		Chiang reveals that this is how he views the future when he presents his argument against free will,
		or in favor of his theory of a predetermined free will.He describes the already existing predetermined future as\ "The Book of Ages\". He anticipates some of the logical problems that such a book would entail, such as the conflict between the concepts of free will and predeterminism, but he presents it as a struggle to overcome the previously authored book of ages. <
		blockquote > Or,
		to be generous,
		some might say that the Book of Ages could exist,
		as long as it wasn’ t accessible to readers:
				that volume is housed in a special collection,
			and no one has viewing privileges. < /blockquote>
			The author of the story steamrolls all other authors.It\ 's like a partial solipsism. He can read the future and then asks silly questions like \"what would you choose if you already knew the future?\"

			Louise describes three sequences of events that overlap but that have similar qualities.Gary is interested in her sexually and she sees it coming,
			Gary\ 's and her future daughter accidently pulls a salad bowl from a shelf which falls on her head, and while Gary and her shop for clams at the local market she pulls a salad bowl off the shelf to purchase it. Chiang shows Louise recognizing the similarity betweeen these three sequences as we see in the following dense passage: <
			blockquote > I reached out and took the bowl from the shelf.The motion didn’ t feel like something I was forced to do .Instead it seemed just as urgent as my rushing to
			catch
			the bowl when it falls on you: an instinct that I felt right in following.“I could use a salad bowl like this.”Gary looked at the bowl and nodded approvingly.“See,
			wasn’ t it a good thing that I had to stop at the market ? ”“Yes it was.”We got in line to pay
			for our purchases. < /blockquote>
			The story of language has been directed by a purpose,
			to show that by thinking differently we can acquire new abilities which are not possible to us as we think now.

			Louise acquires a special ability.By thinking in a new language she overcomes the limitations placed on her by human language.The inability to remember the future is supposed to be a constraint imposed on our minds by the way we speak. & nbsp;

			so the title event of the film is taken as a given.They just show up there hovering and silent in cloud - piercing shell - shaped obelisques that hover without any detectable disturbance.

			The aliens,
			called heptapods
			for seven - legged,
			have the same basic form as octopus but with seven advanced tentacles from which they can dispense ink which they form into complex circular symbols.Each circular symbol has minor irregularities which are the content of the message.It is effectively a short sentence with the end of the sentence joined to the beginning.Whatever sci - fi space travel might be in this film is there solely to abstract out and present one single concept: The visitors have brought with them a payload which is carried in their language.The payload is the idea that the sequential nature of time is an illusion.

			The alien language is used as a portal to a special ability.Linguistic relativity,
			also called Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis,
			is the theory that the reality we experience is determined by the language we use.So as Louise learns a nonlinear language,
			one where sentences are circular and can be started at any point in the circle,
			her perception of time becomes non - linear.The film uses the strong interpretation of the Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis by showing that Louise actually overcomes the sequential nature of time by learning the new language.She remembers the future.

			I don\ 't subscribe to this idea but I\'m going to attempt to give it a full explanation. The future already exists and, if you know how, it is possible to access future occurances by a process similar to remembering, but about the future. In this view of the world, the future already exists. It\'s already there. The fact that we can\'t acquire knowledge of it just illustrates a limitation with our form of thinking. If we could use some other thought process,then we would be able to have cognitive access to future events as well as past events. Wouldn\'t that be cool?

			The
		case infavor of this idea was not presented very well in the movie so I was tempted to investigate the book version of the story where I found a better and more thorough presentation,
		so I am going to include that in this film review since it\ 's part of the original story and was probably left out of the film simply for time considerations.

		Ted Chiang is the author,
		but he presents the
		case through the main character,
		Louise.She is narrating the process of her discoveries of the alien language.As she becomes adept at writing the language she is supposed to be gaining special insights into the way that the aliens think.

		There is the additional observation that even
		if you did know all about the future,
		and that something bad would happen in the future,
		you might not change any of choices you made in your life.For instance
		if you knew that your child would die of cancer at the age of 25 you might still choose to conceive and rear that child.

		For the future to be knowable,
		it must exist.It must already be there like the later part of a film or book which you are reading,
		but which you have not gotten to yet,
		or a film that you are in the middle of watching,
		but that has already been filmed.

		It would be different to say you know how a dramatic series will progress
		if that series had not yet been fully written.If you could describe it,
		scene by scene,
		how the actors would carry themselves and subtle lighting effects,
		before the that part of the series had even been authored your claims would raise doubts. & nbsp;

		It is interesting that authors often seem to have this view of an already authored future,
		but they don\ 't usually have it of an already authored book they are writing. If the future already exists then the book they are writing is already written. In such a case they would have no choice in the matter and no claim of authorship over the finneshed product. But that is not how they view the supposedly groundbreaking book or screenplay they are writing, only all the rest of reality, including the lives of others.

		Chiang reveals that this is how he views the future when he presents his argument against free will,
		or in favor of his theory of a predetermined free will.He describes the already existing predetermined future as\ "The Book of Ages\". He anticipates some of the logical problems that such a book would entail, such as the conflict between the concepts of free will and predeterminism, but he presents it as a struggle to overcome the previously authored book of ages. <
		blockquote > Or,
		to be generous,
		some might say that the Book of Ages could exist,
		as long as it wasn’ t accessible to readers:
				that volume is housed in a special collection,
			and no one has viewing privileges. < /blockquote>
			The author of the story steamrolls all other authors.It\ 's like a partial solipsism. He can read the future and then asks silly questions like \"what would you choose if you already knew the future?\"

			Louise describes three sequences of events that overlap but that have similar qualities.Gary is interested in her sexually and she sees it coming,
			Gary\ 's and her future daughter accidently pulls a salad bowl from a shelf which falls on her head, and while Gary and her shop for clams at the local market she pulls a salad bowl off the shelf to purchase it. Chiang shows Louise recognizing the similarity betweeen these three sequences as we see in the following dense passage: <
			blockquote > I reached out and took the bowl from the shelf.The motion didn’ t feel like something I was forced to do .Instead it seemed just as urgent as my rushing to
			catch
			the bowl when it falls on you: an instinct that I felt right in following.“I could use a salad bowl like this.”Gary looked at the bowl and nodded approvingly.“See,
			wasn’ t it a good thing that I had to stop at the market ? ”“Yes it was.”We got in line to pay
			for our purchases. < /blockquote>
			The story of language has been directed by a purpose,
			to show that by thinking differently we can acquire new abilities which are not possible to us as we think now.

			Louise acquires a special ability.By thinking in a new language she overcomes the limitations placed on her by human language.The inability to remember the future is supposed to be a constraint imposed on our minds by the way we speak. & nbsp;

			her perception of time becomes non - linear.The film uses the strong interpretation of the Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis by showing that Louise actually overcomes the sequential nature of time by learning the new language.She remembers the future.

			I don\ 't subscribe to this idea but I\'m going to attempt to give it a full explanation. The future already exists and, if you know how, it is possible to access future occurances by a process similar to remembering, but about the future. In this view of the world, the future already exists. It\'s already there. The fact that we can\'t acquire knowledge of it just illustrates a limitation with our form of thinking. If we could use some other thought process,then we would be able to have cognitive access to future events as well as past events. Wouldn\'t that be cool?

			The
		case infavor of this idea was not presented very well in the movie so I was tempted to investigate the book version of the story where I found a better and more thorough presentation,
		so I am going to include that in this film review since it\ 's part of the original story and was probably left out of the film simply for time considerations.

		Ted Chiang is the author,
		but he presents the
		case through the main character,
		Louise.She is narrating the process of her discoveries of the alien language.As she becomes adept at writing the language she is supposed to be gaining special insights into the way that the aliens think.

		There is the additional observation that even
		if you did know all about the future,
		and that something bad would happen in the future,
		you might not change any of choices you made in your life.For instance
		if you knew that your child would die of cancer at the age of 25 you might still choose to conceive and rear that child.

		For the future to be knowable,
		it must exist.It must already be there like the later part of a film or book which you are reading,
		but which you have not gotten to yet,
		or a film that you are in the middle of watching,
		but that has already been filmed.

		It would be different to say you know how a dramatic series will progress
		if that series had not yet been fully written.If you could describe it,
		scene by scene,
		how the actors would carry themselves and subtle lighting effects,
		before the that part of the series had even been authored your claims would raise doubts. & nbsp;

		It is interesting that authors often seem to have this view of an already authored future,
		but they don\ 't usually have it of an already authored book they are writing. If the future already exists then the book they are writing is already written. In such a case they would have no choice in the matter and no claim of authorship over the finneshed product. But that is not how they view the supposedly groundbreaking book or screenplay they are writing, only all the rest of reality, including the lives of others.

		Chiang reveals that this is how he views the future when he presents his argument against free will,
		or in favor of his theory of a predetermined free will.He describes the already existing predetermined future as\ "The Book of Ages\". He anticipates some of the logical problems that such a book would entail, such as the conflict between the concepts of free will and predeterminism, but he presents it as a struggle to overcome the previously authored book of ages. <
		blockquote > Or,
		to be generous,
		some might say that the Book of Ages could exist,
		as long as it wasn’ t accessible to readers:
				that volume is housed in a special collection,
			and no one has viewing privileges. < /blockquote>
			The author of the story steamrolls all other authors.It\ 's like a partial solipsism. He can read the future and then asks silly questions like \"what would you choose if you already knew the future?\"

			Louise describes three sequences of events that overlap but that have similar qualities.Gary is interested in her sexually and she sees it coming,
			Gary\ 's and her future daughter accidently pulls a salad bowl from a shelf which falls on her head, and while Gary and her shop for clams at the local market she pulls a salad bowl off the shelf to purchase it. Chiang shows Louise recognizing the similarity betweeen these three sequences as we see in the following dense passage: <
			blockquote > I reached out and took the bowl from the shelf.The motion didn’ t feel like something I was forced to do .Instead it seemed just as urgent as my rushing to
			catch
			the bowl when it falls on you: an instinct that I felt right in following.“I could use a salad bowl like this.”Gary looked at the bowl and nodded approvingly.“See,
			wasn’ t it a good thing that I had to stop at the market ? ”“Yes it was.”We got in line to pay
			for our purchases. < /blockquote>
			The story of language has been directed by a purpose,
			to show that by thinking differently we can acquire new abilities which are not possible to us as we think now.

			Louise acquires a special ability.By thinking in a new language she overcomes the limitations placed on her by human language.The inability to remember the future is supposed to be a constraint imposed on our minds by the way we speak. & nbsp;

It doesn\'t work like I thought it did. We are so bound by time. But now I\'m not so sure I believe in beginnings and endings.\"

				This is the first statement in Paramount Pictures\ "Arrival\". If you are looking for the philosophical direction the film is leading us in, you already have your answer.&nbsp;

			The statement is made in a dreamy,
			sing - song inner - voice voiceover which spans cuts to the scene.A slippery relationship between time and memory is the main theme of the film,
			but\ "Arrival\" takes it one step beyond.

			“
			Arrival” is based on a short story by Ted Chiang called“ The Story of Our Lives”.This review is of the film,
			but I did read the short story it was based on to get a deeper understanding of the central idea which wasn\ 't fully explained in the film.

			It’ s billed as drama,
			mystery,
			sci - fi on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes,
			and that is fairly accurate.There is probably not enough science content to just call it sci - fi.Whatever science is in the film is directed towards one overt goal: to present a new idea.There is some discussion of a principle by which a person who learns a new language can develop the ability to see the world in from a special perspective,
			and that they may obtain new cognative capacities.Language is taken as a limiting constraint in this story,
			and the new language is believed to provide new cognitive capabilities,
			even over the sequential nature of time,
			but they run into a logical problem which we will
			return to.

			Visitors arrive from another place.That’ s about all we know about them,
			and that they are very advanced.They show up at will hovering over 12 almost random locations with the apparent intention of talking to people of the various nations and social strata of Earth.They ships aren’ t shown arriving,
			so the title event of the film is taken as a given.They just show up there hovering and silent in cloud - piercing shell - shaped obelisques that hover without any detectable disturbance.

			The method of transportation and arrival establishes the alien beings as highly technologically advanced,
			but excuses the authors from specifying the nature of the advances.Even the entry portals to the are cleverly abstracted.The door disappears upward from the bottom,
			and then to avoid presenting any living quarters or internal walkways the gravity is manipulated in the bottom portal so that the humans can walk upright on the wall.When the alien beings are presented they are on the other side of a large glass wall suspended in what appears to be a milky fluid.

			The aliens,
			called heptapods
			for seven - legged,
			have the same basic form as octopus but with seven advanced tentacles from which they can dispense ink which they form into complex circular symbols.Each circular symbol has minor irregularities which are the content of the message.It is effectively a short sentence with the end of the sentence joined to the beginning.Whatever sci - fi space travel might be in this film is there solely to abstract out and present one single concept: The visitors have brought with them a payload which is carried in their language.The payload is the idea that the sequential nature of time is an illusion.

			The alien language is used as a portal to a special ability.Linguistic relativity,
			also called Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis,
			is the theory that the reality we experience is determined by the language we use.So as Louise learns a nonlinear language,
			one where sentences are circular and can be started at any point in the circle,
			her perception of time becomes non - linear.The film uses the strong interpretation of the Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis by showing that Louise actually overcomes the sequential nature of time by learning the new language.She remembers the future.

In this view of the world, the future already exists. It\'s already there. The fact that we can\'t acquire knowledge of it just illustrates a limitation with our form of thinking. If we could use some other thought process,then we would be able to have cognitive access to future events as well as past events. Wouldn\'t that be cool?

			The
		case infavor of this idea was not presented very well in the movie so I was tempted to investigate the book version of the story where I found a better and more thorough presentation,
		so I am going to include that in this film review since it\ 's part of the original story and was probably left out of the film simply for time considerations.

		Ted Chiang is the author,
		but he presents the
		case through the main character,
		Louise.She is narrating the process of her discoveries of the alien language.As she becomes adept at writing the language she is supposed to be gaining special insights into the way that the aliens think.

		There is the additional observation that even
		if you did know all about the future,
		and that something bad would happen in the future,
		you might not change any of choices you made in your life.For instance
		if you knew that your child would die of cancer at the age of 25 you might still choose to conceive and rear that child.

		For the future to be knowable,
		it must exist.It must already be there like the later part of a film or book which you are reading,
		but which you have not gotten to yet,
		or a film that you are in the middle of watching,
		but that has already been filmed.

		It would be different to say you know how a dramatic series will progress
		if that series had not yet been fully written.If you could describe it,
		scene by scene,
		how the actors would carry themselves and subtle lighting effects,
		before the that part of the series had even been authored your claims would raise doubts. & nbsp;

		It is interesting that authors often seem to have this view of an already authored future,
		but they don\ 't usually have it of an already authored book they are writing. If the future already exists then the book they are writing is already written. In such a case they would have no choice in the matter and no claim of authorship over the finneshed product. But that is not how they view the supposedly groundbreaking book or screenplay they are writing, only all the rest of reality, including the lives of others.

		Chiang reveals that this is how he views the future when he presents his argument against free will,
		or in favor of his theory of a predetermined free will.He describes the already existing predetermined future as\ "The Book of Ages\". He anticipates some of the logical problems that such a book would entail, such as the conflict between the concepts of free will and predeterminism, but he presents it as a struggle to overcome the previously authored book of ages. <

		to be generous,
		some might say that the Book of Ages could exist,

			and no one has viewing privileges. < /blockquote>
			The author of the story steamrolls all other authors.It\ 's like a partial solipsism. He can read the future and then asks silly questions like \"what would you choose if you already knew the future?\"

			Louise describes three sequences of events that overlap but that have similar qualities.Gary is interested in her sexually and she sees it coming,
			Gary\ 's and her future daughter accidently pulls a salad bowl from a shelf which falls on her head, and while Gary and her shop for clams at the local market she pulls a salad bowl off the shelf to purchase it. Chiang shows Louise recognizing the similarity betweeen these three sequences as we see in the following dense passage: <
			blockquote > I reached out and took the bowl from the shelf.The motion didn’ t feel like something I was forced to do .Instead it seemed just as urgent as my rushing to

			The story of language has been directed by a purpose,

It doesn\'t work like I thought it did. We are so bound by time. But now I\'m not so sure I believe in beginnings and endings.\"

				This is the first statement in Paramount Pictures\ "Arrival\". If you are looking for the philosophical direction the film is leading us in, you already have your answer.&nbsp;

			The statement is made in a dreamy,
			inner - voiceover which spans cuts to the scene in a style which has become trendy in \"groundbreaking\" thought-pieces. A slippery relationship between time and memory is the main theme of the film, but \"Arrival\" takes it one step beyond.

			“
			Arrival” is based on a short story by Ted Chiang called“ The Story of Our Lives”.This review is of the film but will briefly refer to the short story the film was based on which has a deeper explanation of the central idea which wasn\ 't fully explained in the film.

			It’ s billed as drama,
			mystery,
			sci - fi on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes,
			and that is fairly accurate.There is probably not enough science content to just call it sci - fi.Whatever science is in the film is directed towards one overt goal: to present a new idea.There is some discussion of a principle by which a person who learns a new language can develop the ability to see the world in from a special perspective,
			and that they may obtain new cognative capacities.Language is taken as a limiting constraint in this story,
			and the new language is believed to provide new cognitive capabilities,
			even over the sequential nature of time,
			but they run into a logical problem which we will
			return to.

			Visitors arrive from another place.That’ s about all we know about them,
			and that they are very advanced.They show up at will hovering over 12 almost random locations with the apparent intention of talking to people of the various nations and social strata of Earth.They ships aren’ t shown arriving,
			so the title event of the film is taken as a given.They just show up there hovering and silent in cloud - piercing shell - shaped obelisques that hover without any detectable disturbance.

			The method of transportation and arrival establishes the alien beings as highly technologically advanced,
			but excuses the authors from specifying the nature of the advances.Even the entry portals to the are cleverly abstracted.The door disappears upward from the bottom,
			and then to avoid presenting any living quarters or internal walkways the gravity is manipulated in the bottom portal so that the humans can walk upright on the wall.When the alien beings are presented they are on the other side of a large glass wall suspended in what appears to be a milky fluid.

			The aliens,
			called heptapods
			for seven - legged,
			have the same basic form as octopus but with seven advanced tentacles from which they can dispense ink which they form into complex circular symbols.Each circular symbol has minor irregularities which are the content of the message.It is effectively a short sentence with the end of the sentence joined to the beginning.Whatever sci - fi space travel might be in this film is there solely to abstract out and present one single concept: The visitors have brought with them a payload which is carried in their language.The payload is the idea that the sequential nature of time is an illusion.

			The alien language is used as a portal to a special ability.Linguistic relativity,
			also called Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis,
			is the theory that the reality we experience is determined by the language we use.So as Louise learns a nonlinear language,
			one where sentences are circular and can be started at any point in the circle,
			her perception of time becomes non - linear.The film uses the strong interpretation of the Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis by showing that Louise actually overcomes the sequential nature of time by learning the new language.She remembers the future.

			I don\ 't subscribe to this idea but I\'m going to attempt to give it a full explanation. The future already exists and, if you know how, it is possible to access future occurances by a process similar to remembering, but about the future. In this view of the world, the future already exists. It\'s already there. The fact that we can\'t acquire knowledge of it just illustrates a limitation with our form of thinking.

			have the same basic form as octopus but with seven advanced tentacles from which they can dispense ink which they form into complex circular symbols.Each circular symbol has minor irregularities which are the content of the message.It is effectively a short sentence with the end of the sentence joined to the beginning.Whatever sci - fi space travel might be in this film is there solely to abstract out and present one single concept: The visitors have brought with them a payload which is carried in their language.The payload is the idea that the sequential nature of time is an illusion.

			I don\ 't subscribe to this idea but I\'m going to attempt to give it a full explanation. The future already exists and, if you know how, it is possible to access future occurances by a process similar to remembering, but about the future. In this view of the world, the future already exists. It\'s already there. The fact that we can\'t acquire knowledge of it just illustrates a limitation with our form of thinking. If we could use some other thought process,then we would be able to have cognitive access to future events as well as past events. Wouldn\'t that be cool?

			The
		case infavor of this idea was not presented very well in the movie so I was tempted to investigate the book version of the story where I found a better and more thorough presentation,
		so I am going to include that in this film review since it\ 's part of the original story and was probably left out of the film simply for time considerations.

		Ted Chiang is the author,
		but he presents the
		case through the main character,
		Louise.She is narrating the process of her discoveries of the alien language.As she becomes adept at writing the language she is supposed to be gaining special insights into the way that the aliens think.

		There is the additional observation that even
		if you did know all about the future,
		and that something bad would happen in the future,
		you might not change any of choices you made in your life.For instance
		if you knew that your child would die of cancer at the age of 25 you might still choose to conceive and rear that child.

		For the future to be knowable,
		it must exist.It must already be there like the later part of a film or book which you are reading,
		but which you have not gotten to yet,
		or a film that you are in the middle of watching,
		but that has already been filmed.

		It would be different to say you know how a dramatic series will progress
		if that series had not yet been fully written.If you could describe it,
		scene by scene,
		how the actors would carry themselves and subtle lighting effects,
		before the that part of the series had even been authored your claims would raise doubts. & nbsp;

		It is interesting that authors often seem to have this view of an already authored future,
		but they don\ 't usually have it of an already authored book they are writing. If the future already exists then the book they are writing is already written. In such a case they would have no choice in the matter and no claim of authorship over the finneshed product. But that is not how they view the supposedly groundbreaking book or screenplay they are writing, only all the rest of reality, including the lives of others.

		Chiang reveals that this is how he views the future when he presents his argument against free will,
		or in favor of his theory of a predetermined free will.He describes the already existing predetermined future as\ "The Book of Ages\". He anticipates some of the logical problems that such a book would entail, such as the conflict between the concepts of free will and predeterminism, but he presents it as a struggle to overcome the previously authored book of ages. <
		blockquote > Or,
		to be generous,
		some might say that the Book of Ages could exist,
		as long as it wasn’ t accessible to readers:
				that volume is housed in a special collection,
			and no one has viewing privileges. < /blockquote>
			The author of the story steamrolls all other authors.It\ 's like a partial solipsism. He can read the future and then asks silly questions like \"what would you choose if you already knew the future?\"

			Louise describes three sequences of events that overlap but that have similar qualities.Gary is interested in her sexually and she sees it coming,
			Gary\ 's and her future daughter accidently pulls a salad bowl from a shelf which falls on her head, and while Gary and her shop for clams at the local market she pulls a salad bowl off the shelf to purchase it. Chiang shows Louise recognizing the similarity betweeen these three sequences as we see in the following dense passage: <
			blockquote > I reached out and took the bowl from the shelf.The motion didn’ t feel like something I was forced to do .Instead it seemed just as urgent as my rushing to
			catch
			the bowl when it falls on you: an instinct that I felt right in following.“I could use a salad bowl like this.”Gary looked at the bowl and nodded approvingly.“See,
			wasn’ t it a good thing that I had to stop at the market ? ”“Yes it was.”We got in line to pay
			for our purchases. < /blockquote>
			The story of language has been directed by a purpose,
			to show that by thinking differently we can acquire new abilities which are not possible to us as we think now.

			Louise acquires a special ability.By thinking in a new language she overcomes the limitations placed on her by human language.The inability to remember the future is supposed to be a constraint imposed on our minds by the way we speak. & nbsp;

			The statement is made in a dreamy,

			“
			Arrival” is based on a short story by Ted Chiang called“ The Story of Our Lives”.This review is of the film but will briefly refer to the short story the film was based on which has a deeper explanation of the central idea which wasn\ 't fully explained in the film.

			It’ s billed as drama,
			mystery,
			sci - fi on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes,
			and that is fairly accurate since there is probably not enough science content to just call it sci - fi.Whatever science is in the film is directed towards one overt goal: to present a new idea.There is some discussion of a principle by which a person who learns a new language can develop the ability to see the world in from a special perspective,
			and that they may obtain new cognative capacities.Language is taken as a limiting constraint in this story,
			and the new language is believed to provide new cognitive capabilities,
			even over the sequential nature of time,
			but they run into a logical problem which we will
			return to.

			Visitors arrive from another place.That’ s about all we know about them,
			and that they are very advanced.They show up at will hovering over 12 almost random locations with the apparent intention of talking to people of the various nations and social strata of Earth.They ships aren’ t shown arriving,
			so the title event of the film is taken as a given.They just show up there hovering and silent in cloud - piercing shell - shaped obelisques that hover without any detectable disturbance.

			The method of transportation and arrival establishes the alien beings as highly technologically advanced,
			but excuses the authors from specifying the nature of the advances.Even the entry portals to the are cleverly abstracted.The door disappears upward from the bottom,
			and then to avoid presenting any living quarters or internal walkways the gravity is manipulated in the bottom portal so that the humans can walk upright on the wall.When the alien beings are presented they are on the other side of a large glass wall suspended in what appears to be a milky fluid.

			The aliens,
			called heptapods
			for seven - legged,

				This is the first statement in Paramount Pictures\ "Arrival\". If you are looking for the philosophical direction the film is leading us in, you already have your answer.

			The statement is made in a dreamy,
			inner - voiceover which spans cuts to the scene in a style which has become trendy in \"groundbreaking\" thought-pieces. A slippery relationship between time and memory is the main theme of the film, but \"Arrival\" takes it one step beyond.

			“
			Arrival” is based on a short story by Ted Chiang called“ The Story of Our Lives”.This review is of the film but will briefly refer to the short story the film was based on which has a deeper explanation of the central idea which wasn\ 't fully explained in the film.

			It’ s billed as drama,
			mystery,
			sci - fi on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes,
			and that is fairly accurate since there is probably not enough science content to just call it sci - fi.Whatever science is in the film is directed towards one overt goal: to present a new idea.There is some discussion of a principle by which a person who learns a new language can develop the ability to see the world in from a special perspective,
			and that they may obtain new cognative capacities.Language is taken as a limiting constraint in this story,
			and the new language is believed to provide new cognitive capabilities,
			even over the sequential nature of time,
			but they run into a logical problem which we will
			return to.

			Visitors arrive from another place.That’ s about all we know about them,
			and that they are very advanced.They show up at will hovering over 12 almost random locations with the apparent intention of talking to people of the various nations and social strata of Earth.They ships aren’ t shown arriving,
			so the title event of the film is taken as a given.They just show up there hovering and silent in cloud - piercing shell - shaped obelisques that hover without any detectable disturbance.

			The method of transportation and arrival establishes the alien beings as highly technologically advanced,
			but excuses the authors from specifying the nature of the advances.Even the entry portals to the are cleverly abstracted.The door disappears upward from the bottom,
			and then to avoid presenting any living quarters or internal walkways the gravity is manipulated in the bottom portal so that the humans can walk upright on the wall.When the alien beings are presented they are on the other side of a large glass wall suspended in what appears to be a milky fluid.

			The aliens,
			called heptapods
			for their seven legs,
			have the same basic form as octopus but with seven advanced tentacles from which they can dispense ink which they form into complex circular symbols.Each circular symbol has minor irregularities which are the content of the message.It is effectively a short sentence with the end of the sentence joined to the beginning.Whatever sci - fi space travel might be in this film is there solely to abstract out and present one single concept: The visitors have brought with them a payload which is carried in their language.The payload is the idea that the sequential nature of time is an illusion.

			The alien language is used as a portal to a special ability.Linguistic relativity,
			also called Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis,

			her perception of time becomes non - linear.The film uses the strong interpretation of the Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis by showing that Louise actually overcomes the sequential nature of time by learning the new language.She remembers the future.

The aliens, called heptapods
for their seven legs, have the same basic form as octopus but with seven advanced tentacles from which they can dispense ink which they form into complex circular symbols.Each circular symbol has minor irregularities which are the content of the message.It is effectively a short sentence with the end of the sentence joined to the beginning.Whatever sci - fi space travel might be in this film is there solely to abstract out and present one single concept: The visitors have brought with them a payload which is carried in their language.The payload is the idea that the sequential nature of time is an illusion. <

The alien language is used as a portal to a special ability.A concept known as linguistic relativity, also called Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis, is a theory that the reality we experience is determined by the language we use.So as Louise learns a nonlinear language, one where sentences are circular and can be started at any point in the circle, her perception of time becomes non - linear.The film uses the strong interpretation of the Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis by showing that Louise actually overcomes the sequential nature of time by learning the new language.She remembers things that have not happened yet.

I don\ 't subscribe to this idea but I\'m going to attempt to give it a full explanation. In this theory the future already exists and, if you know how, it is possible to access future occurrences by a process similar to remembering, but about the future. In this view of the world, the future is already there. It exists in the same way the past exists. The fact that we can\'t acquire knowledge of it just illustrates a limitation of our form of thinking. If we could use some other <em>thought process</em>, then we would be able to have cognitive access to future events as well as past events. Wouldn\'t that be cool?

The
case infavor of this idea was not presented very well in the movie so I was tempted to investigate the book version of the story where I found a better and more thorough presentation, so I am going to include that in this film review since it\ 's part of the original story and was probably left out of the film simply for time considerations.

Ted Chiang is the author of \"The Story of Our Lives\", but he presents the case through the main character, Louise. She is narrating the <em>process of her discoveries</em> of the alien language. As she becomes adept at writing the language she is supposed to be gaining special insights into the way that the aliens think.

For the future to be knowable in the same way the past is knowable, it must already exist.It must already be there like the later part of a book which you are reading, but which you have not gotten to yet, or of a film that you are in the middle of watching, but that has already been filmed.

Chiang describes the already existing predetermined future as\ "The Book of Ages\" which, as he describes, must be without error. He anticipates some of the logical problems that such a book would entail, such as the conflict between the concepts of free will and predeterminism, but he presents it as a struggle to overcome the previously authored book of ages. <
blockquote > Or, to be generous, some might say that the Book of Ages could exist, as long as it wasn’ t accessible to readers:
	that volume is housed in a special collection, and no one has viewing privileges. < /blockquote>
	He makes a compelling
case as he has Louise describe some heartfelt moments in her life and the choices she made during them.

Louise relates three sequences of events that overlap but that have similar qualities.Ian is interested in her sexually and she sees it coming, Ian\ 's and Louise\'s future daughter accidentally pulls a salad bowl from a shelf which falls on her head, and while Ian and her shop for clams at the local market she pulls a salad bowl off the shelf to purchase it. Chiang shows Louise recognizing the similarity between these three sequences as we see in the following dense passage: <
blockquote > I reached out and took the bowl from the shelf.The motion didn’ t feel like something I was forced to do .Instead it seemed just as urgent as my rushing to
catch
the bowl when it falls on you:
	an instinct that I felt right in following.“I could use a salad bowl like this.”Ian looked at the bowl and nodded approvingly.“See, wasn’ t it a good thing that I had to stop at the market ? ”“Yes it was.”We got in line to pay
	for our purchases. < /blockquote>
	The three occurrences don\ 't feel predetermined, Louise tells us. They would only feel predetermined if we were predetermined to feel predetermined. But the author of the \"book of ages\" has written that we feel urgent. She feels urgency in her inevitable coupling with Ian, and with pulling the salad bowl off the shelf at the market. So why should she also not feel urgency when reaching out to protect her child\'s head? <
		h2 id = \"the-shell-game\">The Shell Game</h2>
	This is where the theory starts to fall down like the salad bowl upon the child\ 's head. Louise is not mating with Ian by any choice of her own, but because it is predetermined by the \"book of ages\" and she saw it in the future before it even happened. She had no choice in the matter. Even the urgency she may have felt was preprogrammed into her life as an automaton. We might as well call her Louise-bot.

	A drama / mystery film invests you in the struggles and discoveries of the story\ 's protagonist. This means we are concerned with the protagonists choices and the outcome of their choices. We are constantly asking if they made the right choice, like when Louise doffs her spacesuit in the alien vessel, and how that choice will affect their future.

	The story of the film is all about the sequential processes of discovery that the characters go through over a period of time, not knowing what the results will be until the results are revealed < em > in the future < /em>. The film requires that you watch from the beginning, otherwise it is not much of a mystery or drama.

	When we place a spoiler alert on films it is to indicate that
	if you know the outcome, especially that twist with General Shang, that the story will be\ "spoiled\". The value of the story is the process of it being told.

	The character Louise even stands her ground in the film when other characters ask her to change the order of the process she is using.They ask her to carry out her process out of order, in the same way that learning the result of a future action would be out of order, and she refuses.The character who overcomes the limitation of a sequential order of time is herself intensely protective of her sequential order of teaching the English language to the aliens.

	She is also adamant that discoveries made < em > before < /em> the aliens are properly taught are not real discoveries. She is saying this about aliens who, according the the main plot feature, already know the future. <
		blockquote > Purpose requires understanding of intent.Which means we have to find out
	if they make conscious choices of
		if their motivation is so instinctive they don\ 't understand a \"why\" question, and biggest of all, we need to have enough of a vocabulary with them so we understand their answer.<cite>Louise</cite></blockquote>
	Of course it is meaningless to talk about the\ "intent\" or \"motivation\" of entities which have no choice in their behavior, but it is also meaningless for Louise to talk about her own \"need\" and \"understanding\" if she acheives the predeterminism she and the film strive for.

	And it is not just the main character of the story who is protective of the sequential process.It is also the author of the screenplay:
		<
		blockquote > This movie was about process— the process of cracking a new language and teaching our own. < cite > Eric Heisserer < /cite></blockquote >
		The writer makes it clear that certain parts of the process must come in the right order, even though the entire conclusion of his film is that the sequential order of time is an illusion. <
		blockquote > I returned with the core question humanity wanted answered by the heptapods, written on a page.I dissected the question one word at a time in a defense of the need
	for basics.I realized how ridiculous I sounded: Here I was, defending a series of little scenes of a woman teaching alien life words like“ eat” and“ walk” and“ home.”But this movie is about process, and I was passionate about protecting Louise’ s process. < cite > Eric Heisserer < /cite></blockquote >
		This story of a language has been directed by a purpose, to show that by thinking differently we can acquire new abilities which are not possible to us as we think now.

	Louise acquires a special ability.By thinking in a new language she overcomes the limitations placed on her by human language.The inability to remember the future is supposed to be a constraint imposed on our minds by the way we speak.

	Yet, the same author that reveals this to us and wants to liberate us from the constraints of time that our language has imposed on us is intensely concerned with his character\ 's sequential process of development within the sequential telling of the story: <
		blockquote > In all my draft work on the adaptation, I spent the most time on the intellectual and political challenges of the story.But
	if I ever encroached on the intimate, emotional through - line of Louise’ s journey, the story fell apart.Other scenes could be sacrificed, reworked, moved, or cut to the bone.But director Denis Villeneuve and I found a bare minimum of steps to Louise’ s personal journey, and that became our Alamo;
	our hill we would die defending. < cite > Eric Heisserer < /cite></blockquote >
		In fact the main pay - off of the mystery, that Louise tells General Shang his wife\ 's dying words, doesn\'t even work if anyone else knew it in advance, that is to say if they knew it out of the order in which the author revealed it. If Shang could sometimes see things out of sequence he would have been entirely unimpressed. It is only surprising because it never actually happens anywhere all of recorded history.

	It is a mystical mechanism that only the author knows, by which he has granted a peek at the\ "book of ages\" to his protagonist while denying it to the rest of reality.

	But he still wants us to be invested in the twists and turns of the plot and await the outcome as he tells it so his story keeps us in some level of suspense and shocks us at the right time.

	Eric Heisserer shows great interest in technical processes, but that entire field of thinking is built on the sequence of cause and effect.He portrays that process admirably in the film.It is a process that depends on an orderly sequence of action, observation, and validation.

	That sequence would be meaningless
	if the premise of his film were true.Thoughts would float in and out of Louise\ 's mind and she would have no way of knowing if it was a memory of the past or of some time yet to come. She would not even know when she was. That is to say she would not know where in time she was. Is it now and hour after she put the clothes in the drier or a day after, or an hour before?

	It is interesting that authors often seem to have this view of an already authored future, but they don\ 't usually have it of an already authored book they are writing. If the future already exists then the book they are writing is already written. In such a case they would have no choice in the matter and no claim of authorship over the finished product. But that is not how they view the supposedly groundbreaking book or screenplay they are writing, only all the rest of reality, including the lives of others.

	Would an author pretend someone could know the future words other authors would write ? That seems like something too outrageous even
	for authors of time travel and I don\ 't think I\'ve ever seen an example of it. But if ordinary people\'s actions can be written in the supposed \"book of ages\", why not the works of authors?

	The author of the story negates the choices of all future authors.It\ 's like a partial solipsism where he imagines he is reading a book which they cannot read. He can read the future and then asks moot questions like \"If you could see your whole life from start to finish, would you change things?\" Of course you wouldn\'t. You would be preprogrammed not to even want to.

	The result of such a way of thinking is illustrated by a line from the film.Louise writes to her future daughter about the girl\ 's father\'s departure, \"I just told him something he wasn\'t ready to hear, It had to do with a really rare disease, and it\'s unstoppable. Kind of like you with your poetry and art.\" The daughter\'s life, and her poetry and art and a salad bowl falling on her head are all unstoppable, just like a disease. Her daughter has no choices either. It has all been preprogrammed and authored by another.

	It\ 's interresting that another popular drama, HBO\'s \"Westworld\", revolves entirely around the injustice of the very same time of predetermined, other-authored automaton life that \"Arrival\" authors happily bestow upon their protagonist and everyone she loves. The unjust nightmare Westworld\'s protagonists are struggling against is the blissful payoff of \"Arrival\". <
		h2 id = \"the-ideas\">The Ideas</h2>
	Some might say that this is too much analysis, that the film is entertainment.This is where the Phi - Fi project disagrees.Whereas\ "Arrival\" makes the case that the language we learn determines our reality, Phi-Fi is built on the contention that it is the meaning of the words we say and communicate, and that we hold to be true in our minds, that affect our perception of reality.

	The film makes the popular
case that ideas are not as important as societal structures, such as language, and it presents that
case ina sequence of ideas.The film has been translated into a variety of languages.Are it\ 's basic ideas different in each language? Or are the ideas contained in the words and sentences that the author actually wrote, instead of just the language he wrote them in?

It is important
for us to consider and validate the ideas the author presents.

It seems much easier and more common in popular film to present the guiding agent of human action as DNA, such as all the zombie films, or social groups, or language, than ideas.This is probably because it is easier to use an idea about DNA or language than the idea of an idea.The idea of ideas adds a second level of abstraction.It is an abstraction of an abstraction, but no consequential.

In the same way the author warns of the limitation that can be imposed on us by the language we speak in , Phi - Fi warns of the limitations that can be imposed on us by the ideas we choose to accept. < /blockquote>","post_title": "Arrival (2016) Review","post_excerpt": "","post_status": "inherit","comment_status": "closed","ping_status": "closed","post_password": "","post_name": "213-revision-v1","to_ping": "","pinged": "","post_modified": "2016-12-25 20:10:39","post_modified_gmt": "2016-12-26 04:10:39","post_content_filtered": "","post_parent": 213,"guid": "http:/ / phi - fi.com / 213 - revision - v1 / ","

		This is the first statement in Paramount Pictures\ "Arrival\". If you are looking for the philosophical direction the film is leading us in, you already have your answer.

	The statement is made in a dreamy, inner - voice - over which spans cuts to the scene in a style which has become trendy in \"groundbreaking\" thought-pieces. A slippery relationship between time and memory is the main theme of the film, but \"Arrival\" takes it one step beyond.

	“
	Arrival” is based on a short story by Ted Chiang called“ The Story of Our Lives”.This is a review of the film but we\ 'll briefly refer to the short story the film was based on because it has a deeper explanation of the central idea which wasn\'t fully explained in the film.

	It’ s billed as drama, mystery, sci - fi on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, and that is fairly accurate since there is probably not enough science content to just call it sci - fi.Whatever science is in the film is directed towards one overt goal: to present a new idea.There is some discussion of a principle by which a person who learns a new language can develop the ability to see the world in from a special perspective, and that they may obtain new cognitive capacities.Language is taken as a limiting constraint in this story, and the new language is believed to provide new cognitive capabilities, even over the sequential nature of time, but that is something we will want to look at a little more closely than most reviews. <
		h2 id = \"revelations\">Revelations</h2>
	Visitors arrive from another place.That’ s about all we know about them, and that they are very advanced.They show up at will hovering over 12 almost random locations with the apparent intention of talking to people of the various nations and social strata of Earth.Their ships aren’ t shown arriving, so the title event of the film is taken as a given.They just show up there hovering and silent in cloud - piercing shell - shaped obelisks that hover without any detectable disturbance.

	The method of transportation and arrival establishes the alien beings as highly technologically advanced, but excuses the authors from specifying the nature of the advances.Even the entry portals to the ships are cleverly abstracted.The door disappears upward from the bottom, and then to avoid presenting any living quarters or internal walkways the gravity is manipulated in the bottom portal so that the humans can walk upright on the wall.When the alien beings are presented they are on the other side of a large glass wall suspended in what appears to be a milky fluid.It\ 's a very effective method of establishing the aliens as very advanced and inaccessible without getting caught up in technical details.

	The aliens, called heptapods
	for their seven legs, have the same basic form as octopus but with seven advanced tentacles from which they can dispense ink which they form into complex circular symbols.Each circular symbol has minor irregularities which are the content of the message.It is effectively a short sentence with the end of the sentence joined to the beginning.Whatever sci - fi space travel might be in this film is there solely to abstract out and present one single concept: The visitors have brought with them a payload which is carried in their language.The payload is the idea that the sequential nature of time is an illusion. <
		h2 id = \"the-theme\">The Theme</h2>
	The alien language is used as a portal to a special ability.A concept known as linguistic relativity, also called Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis, is a theory that the reality we experience is determined by the language we use.So as Louise learns a nonlinear language, one where sentences are circular and can be started at any point in the circle, her perception of time becomes non - linear.The film uses the strong interpretation of the Sapir - Whorf Hypothesis by showing that Louise actually overcomes the sequential nature of time by learning the new language.She remembers things that have not happened yet.

	I don\ 't subscribe to this idea but I\'m going to attempt to give it a full explanation. In this theory the future already exists and, if you know how, it is possible to access future occurrences by a process similar to remembering, but about the future. In this view of the world, the future is already there. It exists in the same way the past exists. The fact that we can\'t acquire knowledge of it just illustrates a limitation of our form of thinking. If we could use some other <em>thought process</em>, then we would be able to have cognitive access to future events as well as past events. Wouldn\'t that be cool?

	The
case infavor of this idea was not presented very well in the movie so I was tempted to investigate the book version of the story where I found a better and more thorough presentation, so I am going to include that in this film review since it\ 's part of the original story and was probably left out of the film simply for time considerations.

Ted Chiang is the author of \"The Story of Our Lives\", but he presents the case through the main character, Louise. She is narrating the <em>process of her discoveries</em> of the alien language. As she becomes adept at writing the language she is supposed to be gaining special insights into the way that the aliens think.

For the future to be knowable in the same way the past is knowable, it must already exist.It must already be there like the later part of a book which you are reading, but which you have not gotten to yet, or of a film that you are in the middle of watching, but that has already been filmed.

Chiang describes the already existing predetermined future as\ "The Book of Ages\" which, as he describes, must be without error. He anticipates some of the logical problems that such a book would entail, such as the conflict between the concepts of free will and predeterminism, but he presents it as a struggle to overcome the previously authored book of ages. <
blockquote > Or, to be generous, some might say that the Book of Ages could exist, as long as it wasn’ t accessible to readers:
	that volume is housed in a special collection, and no one has viewing privileges. < /blockquote>
	He makes a compelling
case as he has Louise describe some heartfelt moments in her life and the choices she made during them.

Louise relates three sequences of events that overlap but that have similar qualities.Ian is interested in her sexually and she sees it coming, Ian\ 's and Louise\'s future daughter accidentally pulls a salad bowl from a shelf which falls on her head, and while Ian and her shop for clams at the local market she pulls a salad bowl off the shelf to purchase it. Chiang shows Louise recognizing the similarity between these three sequences as we see in the following dense passage: <
blockquote > I reached out and took the bowl from the shelf.The motion didn’ t feel like something I was forced to do .Instead it seemed just as urgent as my rushing to
catch
the bowl when it falls on you:
	an instinct that I felt right in following.“I could use a salad bowl like this.”Ian looked at the bowl and nodded approvingly.“See, wasn’ t it a good thing that I had to stop at the market ? ”“Yes it was.”We got in line to pay
	for our purchases. < /blockquote>
	The three occurrences don\ 't feel predetermined, Louise tells us. They would only feel predetermined if we were predetermined to feel predetermined. But the author of the \"book of ages\" has written that we feel urgent. She feels urgency in her inevitable coupling with Ian, and with pulling the salad bowl off the shelf at the market. So why should she also not feel urgency when reaching out to protect her child\'s head? <
		h2 id = \"the-shell-game\">The Shell Game</h2>
	This is where the theory starts to fall down like the salad bowl upon the child\ 's head. Louise is not mating with Ian by any choice of her own, but because it is predetermined by the \"book of ages\" and she saw it in the future before it even happened. She had no choice in the matter. Even the urgency she may have felt was preprogrammed into her life as an automaton. We might as well call her Louise-bot.

	A drama / mystery film invests you in the struggles and discoveries of the story\ 's protagonist. This means we are concerned with the protagonists choices and the outcome of their choices. We are constantly asking if they made the right choice, like when Louise doffs her spacesuit in the alien vessel, and how that choice will affect their future.

	The story of the film is all about the sequential processes of discovery that the characters go through over a period of time, not knowing what the results will be until the results are revealed < em > in the future < /em>. The film requires that you watch from the beginning, otherwise it is not much of a mystery or drama.

	When we place a spoiler alert on films it is to indicate that
	if you know the outcome, especially that twist with General Shang, that the story will be\ "spoiled\". The value of the story is the process of it being told.

	The character Louise even stands her ground in the film when other characters ask her to change the order of the process she is using.They ask her to carry out her process out of order, in the same way that learning the result of a future action would be out of order, and she refuses.The character who overcomes the limitation of a sequential order of time is herself intensely protective of her sequential order of teaching the English language to the aliens.

	She is also adamant that discoveries made < em > before < /em> the aliens are properly taught are not real discoveries. She is saying this about aliens who, according the the main plot feature, already know the future. <
		blockquote > Purpose requires understanding of intent.Which means we have to find out
	if they make conscious choices of
		if their motivation is so instinctive they don\ 't understand a \"why\" question, and biggest of all, we need to have enough of a vocabulary with them so we understand their answer.<cite>Louise</cite></blockquote>
	Of course it is meaningless to talk about the\ "intent\" or \"motivation\" of entities which have no choice in their behavior, but it is also meaningless for Louise to talk about her own \"need\" and \"understanding\" if she acheives the predeterminism she and the film strive for.

	And it is not just the main character of the story who is protective of the sequential process.It is also the author of the screenplay:
		<
		blockquote > This movie was about process— the process of cracking a new language and teaching our own. < cite > Eric Heisserer < /cite></blockquote >
		The writer makes it clear that certain parts of the process must come in the right order, even though the entire conclusion of his film is that the sequential order of time is an illusion. <
		blockquote > I returned with the core question humanity wanted answered by the heptapods, written on a page.I dissected the question one word at a time in a defense of the need
	for basics.I realized how ridiculous I sounded: Here I was, defending a series of little scenes of a woman teaching alien life words like“ eat” and“ walk” and“ home.”But this movie is about process, and I was passionate about protecting Louise’ s process. < cite > Eric Heisserer < /cite></blockquote >
		This story of a language has been directed by a purpose, to show that by thinking differently we can acquire new abilities which are not possible to us as we think now.

	Louise acquires a special ability.By thinking in a new language she overcomes the limitations placed on her by human language.The inability to remember the future is supposed to be a constraint imposed on our minds by the way we speak.

	Yet, the same author that reveals this to us and wants to liberate us from the constraints of time that our language has imposed on us is intensely concerned with his character\ 's sequential process of development within the sequential telling of the story: <
		blockquote > In all my draft work on the adaptation, I spent the most time on the intellectual and political challenges of the story.But
	if I ever encroached on the intimate, emotional through - line of Louise’ s journey, the story fell apart.Other scenes could be sacrificed, reworked, moved, or cut to the bone.But director Denis Villeneuve and I found a bare minimum of steps to Louise’ s personal journey, and that became our Alamo;
	our hill we would die defending. < cite > Eric Heisserer < /cite></blockquote >

	an instinct that I felt right in following.“I could use a salad bowl like this.”Ian looked at the bowl and nodded approvingly.“See, wasn’ t it a good thing that I had to stop at the market ? ”“Yes it was.”We got in line to pay
	for our purchases. < /blockquote>
	The three occurrences don\ 't feel predetermined, Louise tells us. They would only feel predetermined if we were predetermined to feel predetermined. But the author of the \"book of ages\" has written that we feel urgent. She feels urgency in her inevitable coupling with Ian, and with pulling the salad bowl off the shelf at the market. So why should she also not feel urgency when reaching out to protect her child\'s head? <
		h2 id = \"the-shell-game\">The Shell Game</h2>
	This is where the theory starts to fall down like the salad bowl upon the child\ 's head. Louise is not mating with Ian by any choice of her own, but because it is predetermined by the \"book of ages\" and she saw it in the future before it even happened. She had no choice in the matter. Even the urgency she may have felt was preprogrammed into her life as an automaton. We might as well call her Louise-bot.

	A drama / mystery film invests you in the struggles and discoveries of the story\ 's protagonist. This means we are concerned with the protagonists choices and the outcome of their choices. We are constantly asking if they made the right choice, like when Louise doffs her spacesuit in the alien vessel, and how that choice will affect their future.

	The story of the film is all about the sequential processes of discovery that the characters go through over a period of time, not knowing what the results will be until the results are revealed < em > in the future < /em>. The film requires that you watch from the beginning, otherwise it is not much of a mystery or drama.

	When we place a spoiler alert on films it is to indicate that
	if you know the outcome, especially that twist with General Shang, that the story will be\ "spoiled\". The value of the story is the process of it being told.

	The character Louise even stands her ground in the film when other characters ask her to change the order of the process she is using.They ask her to carry out her process out of order, in the same way that learning the result of a future action would be out of order, and she refuses.The character who overcomes the limitation of a sequential order of time is herself intensely protective of her sequential order of teaching the English language to the aliens.

	She is also adamant that discoveries made < em > before < /em> the aliens are properly taught are not real discoveries. She is saying this about aliens who, according the the main plot feature, already know the future. <
		blockquote > Purpose requires understanding of intent.Which means we have to find out
	if they make conscious choices of
		if their motivation is so instinctive they don\ 't understand a \"why\" question, and biggest of all, we need to have enough of a vocabulary with them so we understand their answer.<cite>Louise</cite></blockquote>
	Of course it is meaningless to talk about the\ "intent\" or \"motivation\" of entities which have no choice in their behavior, but it is also meaningless for Louise to talk about her own \"need\" and \"understanding\" if she acheives the predeterminism she and the film strive for.

	And it is not just the main character of the story who is protective of the sequential process.It is also the author of the screenplay:
		<
		blockquote > This movie was about process— the process of cracking a new language and teaching our own. < cite > Eric Heisserer < /cite></blockquote >
		The writer makes it clear that certain parts of the process must come in the right order, even though the entire conclusion of his film is that the sequential order of time is an illusion. <
		blockquote > I returned with the core question humanity wanted answered by the heptapods, written on a page.I dissected the question one word at a time in a defense of the need
	for basics.I realized how ridiculous I sounded: Here I was, defending a series of little scenes of a woman teaching alien life words like“ eat” and“ walk” and“ home.”But this movie is about process, and I was passionate about protecting Louise’ s process. < cite > Eric Heisserer < /cite></blockquote >
		This story of a language has been directed by a purpose, to show that by thinking differently we can acquire new abilities which are not possible to us as we think now.

	Louise acquires a special ability.By thinking in a new language she overcomes the limitations placed on her by human language.The inability to remember the future is supposed to be a constraint imposed on our minds by the way we speak.

	Yet, the same author that reveals this to us and wants to liberate us from the constraints of time that our language has imposed on us is intensely concerned with his character\ 's sequential process of development within the sequential telling of the story: <
		blockquote > In all my draft work on the adaptation, I spent the most time on the intellectual and political challenges of the story.But
	if I ever encroached on the intimate, emotional through - line of Louise’ s journey, the story fell apart.Other scenes could be sacrificed, reworked, moved, or cut to the bone.But director Denis Villeneuve and I found a bare minimum of steps to Louise’ s personal journey, and that became our Alamo;
	our hill we would die defending. < cite > Eric Heisserer < /cite></blockquote >
		In fact the main pay - off of the mystery, that Louise tells General Shang his wife\ 's dying words, doesn\'t even work if anyone else knew it in advance, that is to say if they knew it out of the order in which the author revealed it. If Shang could sometimes see things out of sequence he would have been entirely unimpressed. It is only surprising because it never actually happens anywhere all of recorded history.

	It is a mystical mechanism that only the author knows, by which he has granted a peek at the\ "book of ages\" to his protagonist while denying it to the rest of reality.

	But he still wants us to be invested in the twists and turns of the plot and await the outcome as he tells it so his story keeps us in some level of suspense and shocks us at the right time.

	Eric Heisserer shows great interest in technical processes, but that entire field of thinking is built on the sequence of cause and effect.He portrays that process admirably in the film.It is a process that depends on an orderly sequence of action, observation, and validation.

	That sequence would be meaningless
	if the premise of his film were true.Thoughts would float in and out of Louise\ 's mind and she would have no way of knowing if it was a memory of the past or of some time yet to come. She would not even know when she was. That is to say she would not know where in time she was. Is it now and hour after she put the clothes in the drier or a day after, or an hour before?

	It is interesting that authors often seem to have this view of an already authored future, but they don\ 't usually have it of an already authored book they are writing. If the future already exists then the book they are writing is already written. In such a case they would have no choice in the matter and no claim of authorship over the finished product. But that is not how they view the supposedly groundbreaking book or screenplay they are writing, only all the rest of reality, including the lives of others.

	Would an author pretend someone could know the future words other authors would write ? That seems like something too outrageous even
	for authors of time travel and I don\ 't think I\'ve ever seen an example of it. But if ordinary people\'s actions can be written in the supposed \"book of ages\", why not the works of authors?

	The author of the story negates the choices of all future authors.It\ 's like a partial solipsism where he imagines he is reading a book which they cannot read. He can read the future and then asks moot questions like \"If you could see your whole life from start to finish, would you change things?\" Of course you wouldn\'t. You would be preprogrammed not to even want to.

	The result of such a way of thinking is illustrated by a line from the film.Louise writes to her future daughter about the girl\ 's father\'s departure, \"I just told him something he wasn\'t ready to hear, It had to do with a really rare disease, and it\'s unstoppable. Kind of like you with your poetry and art.\" The daughter\'s life, and her poetry and art and a salad bowl falling on her head are all unstoppable, just like a disease. Her daughter has no choices either. It has all been preprogrammed and authored by another.

	It\ 's interresting that another popular drama, HBO\'s \"Westworld\", revolves entirely around the injustice of the very same time of predetermined, other-authored automaton life that \"Arrival\" authors happily bestow upon their protagonist and everyone she loves. The unjust nightmare Westworld\'s protagonists are struggling against is the blissful payoff of \"Arrival\". <
		h2 id = \"the-ideas\">The Ideas</h2>
	Some might say that this is too much analysis, that the film is entertainment.This is where the Phi - Fi project disagrees.Whereas\ "Arrival\" makes the case that the language we learn determines our reality, Phi-Fi is built on the contention that it is the meaning of the words we say and communicate, and that we hold to be true in our minds, that affect our perception of reality.

	The film makes the popular
case that ideas are not as important as societal structures, such as language, and it presents that
case ina sequence of ideas.The film has been translated into a variety of languages.Are it\ 's basic ideas different in each language? Or are the ideas contained in the words and sentences that the author actually wrote, instead of just the language he wrote them in?

It is important
for us to consider and validate the ideas the author presents.

It seems much easier and more common in popular film to present the guiding agent of human action as DNA, such as all the zombie films, or social groups, or language, than ideas.This is probably because it is easier to use an idea about DNA or language than the idea of an idea.The idea of ideas adds a second level of abstraction.It is an abstraction of an abstraction, but no consequential.

In the same way the author warns of the limitation that can be imposed on us by the language we speak in , Phi - Fi warns of the limitations that can be imposed on us by the ideas we choose to accept. < /blockquote>","post_title": "Arrival (2016) Review","post_excerpt": "","post_status": "inherit","comment_status": "closed","ping_status": "closed","post_password": "","post_name": "213-revision-v1","to_ping": "","pinged": "","post_modified": "2017-01-22 18:51:27","post_modified_gmt": "2017-01-23 02:51:27","post_content_filtered": "","post_parent": 213,"guid": "http:/ / phi - fi.com / 213 - revision - v1 / ","
