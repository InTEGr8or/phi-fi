The season opens with establishment of several character's drive, or long-term intent, but it also explores the two main character's motivation.

WENDY: Is this what we wanted? Another man is dead.

MARTY: People make choices, Wendy, and choices have consequences.

WENDY: Still, you could admit that it was good for us.

It's dificult to tell from this exchange, which was featured in the Season 2 Trailer, if Wendy is saying that the fact that it was good for them poses a problem, which must be "admitted".
