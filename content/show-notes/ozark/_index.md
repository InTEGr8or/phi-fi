# _Ozark_ vs _Breaking Bad_

"Ozark" is an answer to "Breaking Bad". Marty Byrd is actually trying to save his family, unlike Walter White, who was lying to his family the whole time about why he was doing everything in the show. Walter White is satire of some people's idealization of "thug culture" and crime families. All the tragedy was of his own making. Marty Byrd found himself caught up in circumstances he was barely able to escape with his life. Similar scenarios to BB, but a completely different theme.
