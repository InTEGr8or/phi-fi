characters:
  - Dolores Abernathy: Evan Rachel Wood. One of the series' central characters. She is the oldest host still working in the park. Dolores is a rancher's daughter who discovers her entire life is an elaborately constructed lie. Her aesthetic drew influences from Andrew Wyeth's painting Christina's World as well as Lewis Carroll's Alice.
  - Maeve Millay: is portrayed by Thandie Newton. Maeve is a host who acts as the madam of Sweetwater, the largest town in Westworld. Like Dolores, she also discovered that her life is an elaborate lie.
  - Bernard Lowe: is portrayed by Jeffrey Wright. He is the head of the Westworld Programming Division and creator of artificial people. Later in the plot, he is revealed to be a host under Ford's control, made in the image of Westworld's co-creator, Arnold Weber. "Bernard Lowe" is an anagram of "Arnold Weber".
  - Arnold Weber: is portrayed by Jeffrey Wright. He was the co-founder and developer of Westworld alongside Ford.[6]
  - Theodore "Teddy" Flood: is portrayed by James Marsden. He is host in the role of a gunslinger who returns to Sweetwater looking to rekindle his relationship with Dolores.
  - Armistice: is portrayed by Ingrid Bols√∏ Berdal. Armistice is a host who is a brutal and ruthless bandit and a member of Hector Escaton's gang.
  - Ashley Stubbs: is portrayed by Luke Hemsworth. He is the head of Westworld security, charged with monitoring host and human interactions and ensuring the safety of the guests.
  - Theresa Cullen: is portrayed by Sidse Babett Knudsen. She is Westworld's terse operations leader, responsible for keeping the park from sliding into unscripted disarray. She later forms an alliance with Charlotte Hale and Delos to conspire against Dr. Ford and remove him from power. Ford orchestrates the death of Theresa soon after by having Bernard murder her.[7]
  - Lee Sizemore: is portrayed by Simon Quarterman. He is Westworld's narrative director, whose artistic temperament aggravates his co-workers.
  - Hector Escaton: is portrayed by Rodrigo Santoro. Hector is a host who is a wanted gang leader bent on survival.[8]
  - Clementine Pennyfeather: is portrayed by Angela Sarafyan. She is a host who works for Maeve and is one of Westworld's most popular attractions. When she is decommissioned, her role is given to another host (portrayed by guest actress Lili Simmons in season 1) and the lobotomised Clementine is put into cold storage.[9]
  - Elsie Hughes: is portrayed by Shannon Woodward. A rising star in the Programming Division tasked with remedying odd behavior in the park's hosts.
  - William: also known as the Man in Black or Bill, is portrayed by Jimmi Simpson as a young man and by Ed Harris as an elderly man. He was a reluctant first-time visitor to Westworld, joining his future brother-in-law, Logan. Initially dismissive of the park's more lascivious attractions, he slowly uncovered a deeper meaning to the park's narrative. He later became a rich, sadistic Westworld guest searching for a "deeper level" in the park. Outside of the park, he has achieved prominence as the owner of a medical foundation, and is a board member of Delos.[10]
  - Robert Ford: is portrayed by Anthony Hopkins. He is the founder and creative director of Westworld. It was eventually revealed that he had been orchestrating the host uprising with his new and final park narrative, "Journey into Night". Similar to his old partner Arnold, he wanted hosts such as Dolores and Maeve to achieve consciousness ("reaching the center of the maze") and break free of their chains. At the end of Season 1, after enlightening Dolores, he allowed himself to be killed by Dolores out of her own free will.
  - Logan Delos: is portrayed by Ben Barnes. He is a veteran guest. His hedonistic romp through Westworld is equally motivated by self-indulgence and a desire to help his friend and future brother-in-law, William.[11]
  - Lawrence Pedro: Maria Gonzalez is portrayed by Clifton Collins Jr.. He is a host with a reputation as a charming but lethal outlaw with a knack for maneuvering and negotiating the various criminal elements of Westworld. In the past, the host portrayed El Lazo.
  - El Lazo: is a host role formerly filled by Lawrence, portrayed by Clifton Collins Jr.. In the season 1 flashbacks, the host El Lazo encountered Logan, William and Dolores in Pariah. Sometime later, the role of El Lazo was assigned to another host. In season 2, the new El Lazo is portrayed by guest actor Giancarlo Esposito.
  - Charlotte Hale: is portrayed by Tessa Thompson. Delos' executive director of the board overseeing Westworld. She seeks to smuggle Ford's hosts' data out of Westworld on behalf of Delos and allow the company to wrest control of the park away from him.[12]

Once he is decommissioned, the role of Peter Abernathy is given to another host (portrayed by recurring actor Bradford Tatum in season 1) and he is put into cold storage. He is later used by Charlotte Hale and Delos to smuggle intellectual property out of the park.
