Arnold returns to the moment he expresses his fear of what Delores could become. He says he has a choice to make, but he is not sure if it's his choice.

But when are we? Delores corrects Bernard, who is reenacting Arnold's words. She says "He didn't question whether he had agency, but whether he should". Bernard does not understand.

Delores says "cease all motor functions". She is the author. She is testing Bernard for "fidelity" just like William was testing Delos-bot.

Rebooted Teddy arrives in the saloon.
