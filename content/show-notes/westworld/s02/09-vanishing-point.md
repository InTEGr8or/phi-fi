In "Kiksuya" the Indian captor says he cannot let William go on, and when William's daughter asks why he is caring for William, he says "I want it to hurt".

The quote on the HBO Westworld episode page is "Try to kill it all away, but I remember everything."

William's daughter says her plan will hurt more than anything the Indian can do.

William talks about the darkness in his soul, or conscience or mind. His wife saw it. It has something to do with lusting after Delores, or wanting to poses her, or control her.

Ford is a little voice in Bernard's head, guiding him to save the hosts or something.

William's daughter: I want in.

Bernard says if he can get to the Forge he can "dictate the outcome they want".

AT first we didn't know what we'd need, so we recorded everything.

"Is this real? Are you real? Did you ever love me? Tell me the truth. Tell me one true thing. If you keep pretending you're not going to remember who you are."
