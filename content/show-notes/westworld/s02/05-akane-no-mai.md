In Shogun world Maeve and her crew meet their doubles. Lee Sizemore says he had to repurpose their narratives in the interest of time.

How do we know Lee Sizemore is actually authoring his own statements? 

In order for Westworld to make a groundbreaking contribution, they should make some statement about the code that characters are following. They have given us some hint at these, actually. We have some idea what is driving Maeve and what is leading Delores down the wrong path, but will there be a discussion of these conflicting ideals?
