Intro is spoken word, credits

The husband, Grey, fixes an old car, while the wife drives home in super modern tech. The husband “stays home all day” fixing cars. Must be a writer.

The husband's friend, Aaron keen, owner of vessel computers, plays with clouds, like a “good”.

Chips cause unemployment.

Keen is husbands lady paying customers.

Car goes in wrong direction, and they can't control it.

The robbers have some kind of ideological motivating.

The guy starts out as anti-new tech. Then he is cared for by advanced tech, and his mom. He is resentful. And the tech fails are insulting. And if dead wife will join for dinner, apparently losing context.

GREG: I’m not looking to rebuild my life. I'm looking for the off switch.
KEEN: Computers can't do everything. They can't bring her back. But they might be able to bring you back. What would she want?

KEEN: No one can know. They make people like me wait years to try this.

Cops software says Grey is incompatible suspect. Another tech failure. Cop overrides.

The net-net of the whole story is that tech is coming to get us, but not even the techness of it. It’s the selfness. Once the tech acquires self-hood it becomes our nemesis. There are lots of tech glitches, tech that fails to do what it is supposed to. That is not the deep problem. The deep problem is the infallible tech, the tech that doesn’t glitch. That’s the real problem, especially after it develops it’s own intentions.

It’s taken as obvious that if the tech needs a test subject, then it will murder a woman and cripple her husband, as a first-try, to get a test subject, even though everyone already has tech implants, even illegal ones like guns implanted in arms. So people are already doing black-market tech installs, but if this infallible tech needs just one more subject he’s going to have to kill a woman and cripple her husband in order to get just one more test subject, after the millions of test subjects that have come before. Of course, because it’s infallible tech, right? Anything with _that much power_ will naturally come to kill you. Of course[?]
