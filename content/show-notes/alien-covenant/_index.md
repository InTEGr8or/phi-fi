In the opening sequence Wayland says to David that humans don't know the answer to the most important question of the ages: where do we come from?

What he doesn't explain is why such a question is so important. Will it affect how we treat each other or how we decide who gets what and why? No. What we do know is that we are here, no matter how that happened. We know that. And with that knowledge we can already start to make choices.

Why do they land at the low elevation and in the deep water that may contain not-easily-visible visitors? Especially if they already know that the target is at a higher elevation.

Why are they surprised at the wheat and why do they say "who planted it?" Did they forget they came there to find the source of a radio transmission? Could it be that the person who knows how to operate a radio might be able to figure out how to plant wheat?

Why would they breath the air? Have they ever heard of airborne disease or micro toxins? Duh. They jeapordize their own lives and  the whole mission by strolling out as if they already know that nothing bad is in the air. Oh, surprise! Something goes up there nose! Who could ever have guessed? Didn't they read Artemis?

## Disease

People in films like this communicate entirely wrong, and not how emergency responders are purposefully taught to communicate.

What's wrong.
Look, I don't have time to explain right now!

He's coughing, but I can't tell you any more.

Why THE FUCK can't she say any more?

A guy is spitting on the table. "Hey, when are you guys going to be back?" That is the time to start TELLING people about the problem _you are wanting them to deal with_!!! Not the time to start asking them questions! What are these people, like twelve? But that is the writer putting these words in their mouths and the actors complying and the director giving the OK. Full grown adults. Why do they always have trained profeshionals acting like children on the very type of scenarios they are trained for?

"DOn't you fucking tell me to calm down. You didn't just see what I saw! You don't know what it is to be me. Please hurry. Can't tell you any more." Boom!

Hey, if only she would have explained a SINGLE FUCKING THING that she saw, instead of just bitching, maybe the others could have been prepared.

Fassbender is awesome as usual. He plays two parts of man as artifice.

Walter is David's American "country cousin".

The engineers were below and David rained bombs down on them.

What is that If not love?
Duty.

David is a mad scientist.

Perfectly safe, I assure you. Take a look, something to see.

Oh, sure, no nead to report back to my team, duh. I'll just go sight-seeing.
