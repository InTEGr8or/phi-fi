I don't claim to know what the authors were saying in LOST. I know something better. I know what the story meant to me, what it told me, that is true, about the world we live in and about every human life: That each life has a begining, a middle and an end, in that order. That whatever happened, happened. And that while there is an island which is the source of the warmest, most beautiful light, and everything that is good in the world, there are some people who want to destroy that island, and everyone you love.

Knowing that means that you know that it is possible for people to choose such a heinous goal, and that gives you a great respect for the preponderance of people who don't choose it. Most people don't want to destroy the island, and the people who do want to destroy it have to hide their plans from the general public. Most people seek the good, but they have a confused and error prone process of discovering the good. That confusion is a minor inconvenience compared to the problems created by the people who have chosen willful self-destruction and the destruction of everything that is good. The confused people are just easily fooled by the few who actually seek to destroy the island and all that is good.

There are a lot of stories that fixate or revolve around an obsessive centerpoint. In the horror genre this might be a house, a mystical artifact, a village, some other haunted dwelling, or even something abstract like a signal, or a number. These centerpoints are taken to represent something much larger, such as a world-view, and characters are lured within, trapped by the magnatism or gravity of the centerpoint, and the story describes the decent into that centerpoint. But that is the horror genre, which generally instils a horrific view of reality, or a malevolent universe view of reality.

There are many other types of stories that have other fixations, or centerpoints.
