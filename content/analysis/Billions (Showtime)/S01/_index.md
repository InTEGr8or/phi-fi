description: "Season One sets up the two opposing forces: The motive of self-improvement through prosperity vs. the motive of societal control towards some kind of \"greater good\"."

- Bobby Axelrod
- Paul Giomatti

The ideals are starkly laid out. Two entirely opposed ideas of the good, and the good life, and good actions, in the most general sense of the word "good".
