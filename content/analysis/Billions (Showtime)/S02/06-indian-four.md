CHUCK:
Sometimes the best moments follow right after the worst.

Chuck is a human. He has human feelings. In this conversation about his marital meetings he reveals that he has a heart, and that he can grow in some way. He is a living, breathing antagonist.

DACA:
I swore an oath. The same oath you swore. I like nothing more than finding people who violate that oath and making sure they never work in the legal profession again.

Chuck has won greater agency over his jurisdiction, but not by obeying the laws that he applies onto others.
