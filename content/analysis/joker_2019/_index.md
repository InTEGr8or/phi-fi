"Is it just me? Or is it getting crazier out there?"

"Joker" is "The Matrix" of this decade.

It is the film many ideas will be discussed in terms of.

Instead of taking you into the matrix,
it takes you down deep,
into the darkness,
and there
YOU hear
Laughter

#Joker

But whose maniacal laughter are we hearing?

It sounds like metaphysical laughter at the nature of life itself, with the theme song "that's life", a comedy, viewed from the inside.

But the charge "you decide what's funny" points at intellectual insiders. Intellectualists.

Joker says "Comedy is subjective, Murray. Isn't that what they say? All of you, this system that knows SO much, you decide what's right or wrong the same way you decide what's FUNNY or not." The intellectuals, the community of people who should guide moral judgement, failed Joker

---

The vast industry of intellectual moralists, the people who are supposed to provide a rational moral code to efficiently guide our choices within a society, have been co-opted to excuse the whim of political benefactors.

They have become a bad joke, and our lives, the comedy.

---

Instead of a life-affirming rational moral code, built from the bottom up so we could improve our lives from the start, we get a code from the top down, never reaching the ground, for which we are to sacrifice our selves.

PATTY: He'll make a great mayor. Everybody says so.
ARTHUR: Everybody? Who do you talk to?
PATTY: Everybody on the news. He's the only one who can save the city. He owes it to us.

PATTY: Thomas Wayne is a great man. If he saw how we're living, he would be so upset.

---
Thomas Wayne: Until people like that can change.... Those of us who've made something of our lives will always look at those who haven't as nothing but clowns.
