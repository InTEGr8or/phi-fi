Valerian is a story of heroism and adventure told over a love story background. The characters are interesting, especially considering that they are pretty young, and the story-line is exciting and engaging. The visuals are fantastic a treat all to themselves, and reason enough to see the film. The costumes, the landscape and the action scenes are pretty spectacular, but are well blended into the storytelling in the same way they were in The Fifth Element, only newer. 

The tech is one of the highlights of the entire film, and the future tech in the film is also a major appeal. That brings us to one of the main oddities of this film: the author's judgement of tech. Vote for this film if you would like to hear this issue explored more fully.
