Overburdened by lawsuits, superheroes and their families are forced to relocate their lives, and hide their exceptional abilities for the benefit of society.

Released in 2004, The Incredibles covers philosophy touching on the ethics of rescuing others, Individual Identity, and raises the question of whether greatness is ordained by nature, or developed by nurture.

Mr. Incredible: Can't the world just stay safe for ten minutes?
Elastigirl: Leave the world saving to the men? I don't think so.

Incrediboy, Buddy Pine, Â feels forsaken despite being a self proclaimed biggest fan. He becomes the villain Syndrome. Could he have abandonment issues? His first appearance in Mr Incredible's life is at a time where Bob Parr, the man of incredible strength, couldn't imagine himself as a mentor or team mate. Buddy wanted acceptance and guidance from a role model.

Dash Parr lacks stimulation and focus in his environment. Gifted with incredible speed he could envision a future in sports, but is discouraged by his mother for fear of standing out. He and his sister, Violet Parr, wish that they were normal.

Violet lacks self esteem because of how her abilities make her different from other kids, especially boys.

Bob is fired from his unsatisfying job, after throwing his boss through several walls for stopping Bob from helping a victim of a mugging. The layers of walls are like the instances where he was reprimanded for helping others in what the company considered a conflict of interest. Who in real life might believe that helping others is a conflict of rational self interest?

Bob's new job working with Mirage causes a tear in his glory days hero suit. He takes it to Edna-E-Mode, an expert clothing designer whose artistic form follows function as demonstrated in her discussion with Bob about how many heroes die because of their stylistic preference of capes.

Helen Parr enforces the ideal behavior they're held to by society on her family because she believes it will protect them from harm. It incentivizes Bob to lie to his wife about his real habits, and his developing crisis becomes an opportunity when a super hero job is offered shortly after his termination from insurance.

Buddy has weak relationships, and considers his partners to be disposable if their death may suit his own needs. This is seen when Bob Incredible bluffs his intention to kill mirage if he isn't unbound. Syndrome's betrayal is responded to in kind, and Mirage chooses to support the Incredibles.

Mirage: "Next time you gamble. Bet your own life."

Dash's curiosity saves his and his sister's life, when he he witnesses the ignition of a rocket from within the cave's tunnels. Immediately after, Helen eavesdrops the surveillance station curious of her husband's location.

Syndrome: "When Everyone's Super, No One Will Be."

Violet is smart and innovative. She breaks electric bonds by interrupting them with her force field. She is able to troubleshoot a route to Syndrome by using prior rocket launch coordinates.

Bob: I can't lose you again. I'm not strong enough.
Helen: If we work together, you don't have to be.

Syndrome's last grand gesture is to kidnap the baby to groom as his future side kick. Violet reacts by protecting her family from the falling aircraft.

I'm reminded of a quote from another movie, The Straight Story. "A stick by itself is easy to break. Tie a bundle of sticks together and it becomes much harder. That's a family."
